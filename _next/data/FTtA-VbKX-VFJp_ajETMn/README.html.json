We use\nJupyter Book to build the documentation’s HTML, and then Next.js to build the\ntheme.</p>\n<p>This works by running <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">jupyter</span> <span class=\"pre\">book</span> <span class=\"pre\">build</span> <span class=\"pre\">.</span></code> to build the HTML. This produces\nHTML that is specifically <span class=\"xref myst\">templated</span> a certain way for\neasier web scraping.</p>\n<p>We then use a <span class=\"xref myst\">catch-all page</span> to render\nevery page generated by the documentation. This page then uses the\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">getStaticProps()</a>\nfunction to scrape the HTML created by <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">jupyter-book</span> <span class=\"pre\">build</span></code>.</p>\n<p>To build the page for production, we then run <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">next</span> <span class=\"pre\">build</span></code> to build the source\ncode and then <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">next</span> <span class=\"pre\">export</span></code> to export the application as HTML. This is known as\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://jamstack.org/glossary/pre-render/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">pre-rendering</a>, and it works by\nhaving the Next.js server render every page once to an HTML file. This then\nallows us to distribute the docs + theme as HTML so we can upload it to GitHub\npages.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight-default notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span>\n</pre></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"highlight-default notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span>\n</pre></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n    <script type=\"text/x-thebe-config\">\n    {\n        requestKernel: true,\n        binderOptions: {\n            repo: \"binder-examples/jupyter-stacks-datascience\",\n            ref: \"master\",\n        },\n        codeMirrorConfig: {\n            theme: \"abcdef\",\n            mode: \"python\"\n        },\n        kernelOptions: {\n            kernelName: \"python3\",\n            path: \"./theme\"\n        },\n        predefinedOutput: true\n    }\n    </script>\n    <script>kernelName = 'python3'</script>\n      ","pageHeaders":[{"href":"#page-customization","text":"Page Customization"},{"href":"#how-does-it-work","text":"How does it work?"}],"ipynbSource":"","mdSource":"/_sources/theme/README.md"}},"__N_SSG":true}
