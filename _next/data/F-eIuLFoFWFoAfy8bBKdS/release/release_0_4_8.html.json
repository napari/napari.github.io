interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.\nIt’s designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional\nimages. It’s built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based\nrendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy).</p>\n<p>This release comes with a <strong>big</strong> change with how you use napari: you should no\nlonger wrap viewer calls in the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">with</span> <span class=\"pre\">napari.gui_qt():</span></code> context. Instead, when\nyou want to block and call the viewer, use <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">napari.run()</span></code>. A minimal example:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight-python notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">napari</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">skimage</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">data</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">camera</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">data</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">camera</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"n\">viewer</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">napari</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">view_image</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">camera</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">napari</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">run</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>In interactive workspaces such as IPython and Jupyter Notebook, you should no\nlonger need to use <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">%gui</span> <span class=\"pre\">qt</span></code>, either: napari will enable it for you.</p>\n<p>For more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website:\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://napari.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://napari.org</a></p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"highlights\">\n<h2>Highlights<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#highlights\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>This release adds a new plugin type (i.e. a hook specification) for plugins to\nprovide sample data (#2483). No more demos with <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">np.random</span></code>! 🎉 We’ve added a\nbuilt-in sample data plugin for this using the scikit-image data module.\nUse it with <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">viewer.open_sample(plugin_name,</span> <span class=\"pre\">sample_name)</span></code>, for example,\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">viewer.open_sample('scikit-image',</span> <span class=\"pre\">'camera')</span></code>. Or you can use the File\nmenu at File -&gt; Open Sample. For more on how to provide your own sample\ndatasets to napari, see <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://napari.org/plugins/stable/for_plugin_developers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">how to write a\nplugin</a> and the\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://napari.org/plugins/stable/hook_specifications.html#napari.plugins.hook_specifications.napari_provide_sample_data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">sample data\nspecification</a>.</p>\n<p>The scale bar now has rudimentary support for physical units 📏 (#2617). To use\nit, set your scale numerically as before, then use <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">viewer.scale_bar.unit</span> <span class=\"pre\">=</span> <span class=\"pre\">'um'</span></code>, for example.</p>\n<p>We have also added a text overlay, which you can use to display arbitrary text\nover the viewer (#2595). You can use this to display time series time stamps,\nfor example. Access it at <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">viewer.text_overlay</span></code>.</p>\n<p>Editing segmentations with napari is easier than ever now with varying number\nof dimensions during painting/filling with labels (#2609). Previously, if you\nwanted to edit segmentations in a time series, you had to choose between\npainting 2D planes, or painting in 4D. Now you can edit individual volumes\nwithout affecting the others.</p>\n<p>If you launch a long running process from napari, you can now display a progress\nbar on the viewer (#2580). You can find usage examples in the repo\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/napari/napari/blob/fa342dc399b636330afdb1b4cb58f919832651fd/examples/progress_bar_minimal.py\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>\nand\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/napari/napari/blob/fa342dc399b636330afdb1b4cb58f919832651fd/examples/progress_bar_segmentation.py\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"new-features\">\n<h2>New Features<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#new-features\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>Add highlight widget to preferences dialog (#2435)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add interface language selection to preferences (#2466)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add Hookspec for providing sample data (#2483)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add ability to run file as plugin (#2503)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">layer.source</span></code> attribute to track layer provenance (#2518)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add button to drop into debugger in the traceback viewer.
