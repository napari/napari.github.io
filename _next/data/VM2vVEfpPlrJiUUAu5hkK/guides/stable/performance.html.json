user has to wait\nfor a result, however with an interactive tool like napari performance is even\nmore critical. Therefore performance is a core feature of napari.</p>\n<p>Inadequate performance will leave the user frustrated and discouraged and they\nwill migrate to other tools or simply give up on interactive exploration of\ntheir data altogether. In contrast, excellent performance will create a joyful\nexperience that encourages longer and more intensive exploration, yielding\nbetter scientific results.</p>\n<p>There are two main types of performance:</p>\n<ol class=\"simple\">\n<li><p><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"#objective-performance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Objective Performance</a></p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>How long operations take when timed with a stopwatch.</p></li>\n<li><p>Most times will vary based on the data being viewed.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"#subjective-performance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Subjective Performance</a></p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>The user’s experience as it relates to performance.</p></li>\n<li><p>Is the user’s experience pleasant or frustrating?
