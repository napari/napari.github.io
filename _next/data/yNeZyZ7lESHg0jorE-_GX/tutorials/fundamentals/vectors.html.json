For help with installation see our\n<a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"installation.html\"><span class=\"doc std std-doc\">installation</span></a> tutorial. For help getting started with the\nviewer see our <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"getting_started.html\"><span class=\"doc std std-doc\">getting started</span></a> tutorial. For help\nunderstanding the organisation of the viewer, including things like the layers\nlist, the layer properties widgets, the layer control panels, and the dimension\nsliders see our <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"viewer.html\"><span class=\"doc std std-doc\">napari viewer</span></a> tutorial.</p>\n<p>This tutorial will teach you about the <strong>napari</strong> <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Vectors</span></code> layer, including how\nto display many vectors simultaneously and adjust their properties. At the end\nof the tutorial you should understand how to add a vectors layer and edit it\nfrom the GUI and from the console.</p>\n<p>The vectors layer allows you to display many vectors with defined starting\npoints and directions. It is particularly useful for people who want to\nvisualize large vector fields, for example if you are doing polarization\nmicroscopy. You can adjust the color, width, and length of all the vectors both\nprogrammatically and from the GUI.</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"a-simple-example\">\n<h2>a simple example<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#a-simple-example\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>You can create a new viewer and add vectors in one go using the\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">napari.view_vectors</span></code> method, or if you already have an existing viewer, you can\nadd shapes to it using <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">viewer.add_vectors</span></code>. The api of both methods is the\nsame. In these examples we’ll mainly use <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">add_vectors</span></code> to overlay shapes onto on\nan existing image.</p>\n<p>In this example of
