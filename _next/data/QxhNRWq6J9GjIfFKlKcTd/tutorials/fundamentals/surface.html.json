<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Surface</span></code> layer!</p>\n<p>This tutorial assumes you have already installed <strong>napari</strong>, know how to launch\nthe viewer, and are familiar with its layout. For help with installation see our\n<a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"installation.html\"><span class=\"doc std std-doc\">installation</span></a> tutorial. For help getting started with the\nviewer see our <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"getting_started.html\"><span class=\"doc std std-doc\">getting started</span></a> tutorial. For help\nunderstanding the organisation of the viewer, including things like the layers\nlist, the layer properties widgets, the layer control panels, and the dimension\nsliders see our <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"viewer.html\"><span class=\"doc std std-doc\">napari viewer</span></a> tutorial.</p>\n<p>This tutorial will teach you about the <strong>napari</strong> <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Surface</span></code> layer, including how\nto display surface data and edit the properties of surfaces like the contrast,\nopacity, colormaps and blending mode. At the end of the tutorial you should\nunderstand how to add and manipulate surfaces both from the GUI and from the\nconsole.</p>\n<p>The surface layer allows you to display a precomputed surface mesh that is\ndefined by an NxD array of N vertices in D coordinates, an Mx3 integer array of\nthe indices of the triangles making up the faces of the surface, and a length N\nlist of values to associate with each vertex to use alongside a colormap.</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"a-simple-example\">\n<h2>a simple example<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#a-simple-example\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>You can create a new viewer and add a surface in one go using the\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">napari.view_surface</span></code> method, or if you already have an existing viewer, you can\nadd an image to it using <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">viewer.add_surface</span></code>. The api of both methods is the\nsame.

The vertices are an NxD array of N vertices in D coordinates. The\nfaces are an Mx3 integer array of the indices of the triangles making up the\nfaces of the surface. The vertex values are a length N list of values to\nassociate with each vertex to use alongside a colormap.

You can list all the available colormaps using\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">layer.colormaps</span></code>.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to create your own colormaps using vispy’s\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">vispy.color.Colormap</span></code> object, see it’s full <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://vispy.org/api/vispy.color.colormap.html#vispy.color.colormap.Colormap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">documentation\nhere</a>.

These are a 2-tuple of values defining how\nwhat values get applied the minimum and maximum of the colormap and follow the\nsame principles as the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">contrast_limits</span></code> described in the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"image.html\"><span class=\"doc std std-doc\">image layer\ntutorial</span></a>. They are also accessible through the same keyword arguments,\nproperties, and range slider as in the image layer.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"layer-visibility\">\n<h2>layer visibility<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#layer-visibility\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>All our layers support a visibility toggle that allows you to set the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">visible</span></code>\nproperty of each layer. This property is located inside the layer widget in the\nlayers list and is represented by an eye icon.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"layer-opacity\">\n<h2>layer opacity<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#layer-opacity\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>All our layers support an opacity slider and <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">opacity</span></code> property that allow you\nto adjust the layer opacity between 0, fully invisible, and 1, fully visible.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"blending-layers\">\n<h2>blending layers<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#blending-layers\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>All our layers support three blending modes <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">translucent</span></code>, <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">additive</span></code>, and\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">opaque</span></code> that determine how the visuals for this layer get mixed with the\nvisuals from the other layers.</p>\n<p>An <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">opaque</span></code> layer renders all the other layers below it invisible and will fade\nto black as you decrease its opacity.</p>\n<p>The <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">translucent</span></code> setting will cause the layer to blend with the layers below it\nif you decrease its opacity but will fully block those layers if its opacity is\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">1</span></code>. This is a reasonable default, useful for many applications.</p>\n<p>The final blending mode <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">additive</span></code> will cause the layer to blend with the layers\nbelow even when it has full opacity. This mode is especially useful for\nvisualizing multiple layers at the same time.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"naming-layers\">\n<h2>naming layers<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#naming-layers\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>All our layers support a <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">name</span></code> property that can be set inside a text box\ninside the layer widget in the layers list. The name of each layer is forced\ninto being unique so that you can use the name to index into <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">viewer.layers</span></code> to\nretrieve the layer object.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"scaling-layers\">\n<h2>scaling layers<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#scaling-layers\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>All our layers support a <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">scale</span></code> property and keyword argument that will rescale\nthe layer multiplicatively according to the scale values (one for each\ndimension). This property can be particularly useful for viewing anisotropic\ndata where the size of the voxel in the z dimension might be different then the\nsize in the x and y dimensions.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"translating-layers\">\n<h2>translating layers<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#translating-layers\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>All our layers support a <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">translate</span></code> property and keyword argument that you can\nuse to offset a layer relative to the other layers, which could be useful if you\nare trying to overlay two layers for image registration purposes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"layer-metadata\">\n<h2>layer metadata<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#layer-metadata\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>All our layers also support a <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">metadata</span></code> property and keyword argument that you\ncan use to store an arbitrary metadata dictionary on the layer.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"next-steps\">\n<h2>next steps<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#next-steps\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>Hopefully, this tutorial has given you a detailed understanding of the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Vectors</span></code>\nlayer, including how to create one and control its properties.
