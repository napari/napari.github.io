Often we write code in a very procedural way: “do this …\nthen do that, etc…”. With napari and other GUI programs however, usually you\nhook up a bunch of conditions to callback functions (e.g. “If this event\nhappens, then call this function”) and <em>then</em> start the loop and hope you hooked\neverything up correctly!  Indeed, much of the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">napari</span></code> source code is\ndedicated to creating and handling events: search the codebase for\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/napari/napari/search?q=%22.emit%28%22&amp;type=code\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">.emit(</span></code></a>\nand\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/napari/napari/search?q=%22.connect%28%22&amp;type=code\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">.connect(</span></code></a>\nto find examples of creating and handling internal events, respectively.</p>\n<p>If you would like to set up a custom event listener then you need to hook into\nthe napari event loop.

Until we have centralized documentation for\nall of the events offered by napari objects, the best way to find these is to\nbrowse the source code.  Take for instance, the base\n<a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../api/stable/napari.layers.Layer.html#napari.layers.Layer\" title=\"napari.layers.Layer\"><code class=\"xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Layer</span></code></a> class: you’ll find in the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">__init__</span></code> method a\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">self.events</span></code> section that looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight-python notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">events</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">EmitterGroup</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n    <span class=\"o\">...</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">data</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">Event</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">name</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">Event</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"o\">...</span>\n<span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>That tells you that all layers are capable of emitting events called <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">data</span></code>, and\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">name</span></code> (among many others) that will (presumably) be emitted when that property\nchanges. To provide your own response to that change, you can hook up a callback\nfunction that accepts the event object:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight-python notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">print_layer_name</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">event</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"nb\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sa\">f</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"si\">{</span><span class=\"n\">event</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">source</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">name</span><span class=\"si\">}</span><span class=\"s2\"> changed its data!\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">layer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">events</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">data</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">connect</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">print_layer_name</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"long-running-blocking-functions\">\n<h2>Long-running, blocking functions<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#long-running-blocking-functions\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>An important detail here is that the napari event loop is running in a <em>single\nthread</em>.

However, if one\nof the events in the queue takes a long time to process, then every other event\nmust wait!</p>\n<p>Take this example in napari:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight-python notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"n\">viewer</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">napari</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Viewer</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># everything is fine so far... but if we trigger a long computation</span>\n<span class=\"n\">image</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">random</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">rand</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">512</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">1024</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">1024</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">mean</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">viewer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">add_image</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">image</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># the entire interface freezes!</span>\n</pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>Here we have a long computation (<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">np.random.rand(512,</span> <span class=\"pre\">1024,</span> <span class=\"pre\">1024).mean(0)</span></code>) that\n“blocks” the main thread, meaning <em>no button press, key press, or any other\nevent can be processed until it’s done</em>.
