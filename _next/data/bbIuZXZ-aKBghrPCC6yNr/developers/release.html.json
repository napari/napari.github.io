It is likely something like <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">X.Y.Z</span></code>.

For example making the release notes\nfor the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">0.2.1</span></code> release can be done as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight-bash notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span>python docs/release/generate_release_notes.py v0.2.0 main --version <span class=\"m\">0</span>.2.1 <span class=\"p\">|</span> tee docs/release/release_0_2_1.md\n</pre></div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li><p>Scan the PR titles for highlights, deprecations, API changes,\nand bugfixes, and mention these in the relevant sections of the notes.\nTry to present the information in an expressive way by mentioning\nthe affected functions, elaborating on the changes and their\nconsequences. If possible, organize semantically close PRs in groups.</p></li>\n<li><p>Make sure the file name is of the form <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">doc/release/release_&lt;major&gt;_&lt;minor&gt;_&lt;release&gt;.md</span></code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Make and merge a PR with these release notes before moving onto the next steps.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"update-translation-strings\">\n<h2>Update translation strings<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#update-translation-strings\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>As new code is included in the codebase, some of the strings that need to be translated might\nnot yet be using the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">trans</span></code> methods. To help keep the codebase up to date in terms\nof translations we added a test script that\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/napari/napari/actions/workflows/test_translations.yml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">runs daily on CI</a>\nand can be also run locally to ensure that a release

file and it relies on an additional\nfile <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">/tools/strings_list.py</span></code> to include strings to skip safely from translation.</p>\n<p>The test checks:</p>\n<ol class=\"simple\">\n<li><p><strong>Untranslated strings</strong>: not using the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span
