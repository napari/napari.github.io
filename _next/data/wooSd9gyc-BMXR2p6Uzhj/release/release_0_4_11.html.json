fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.\nIt’s designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional\nimages. It’s built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based\nrendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy).</p>\n<p>For more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website:\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/napari/napari\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://github.com/napari/napari</a></p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"highlights\">\n<h2>Highlights<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#highlights\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>This release introduces ways to interact with data in 3D (#3037). Features like\nlabel picking (#3074) and label painting/erasing (#3108) now work in 3D, but\nthese are just the beginning! We’re excited to see new ways of annotating 3D\ndata appear in napari! For more details, please see the documentation at\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://napari.org/guides/stable/3D_interactivity.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://napari.org/guides/stable/3D_interactivity.html</a>.\nMany thanks to Alister Burt and Kevin Yamauchi for their foundational work\nsetting up the infrastructure for these features.</p>\n<p>Our volume rendering functionality has been significantly improved and now\nincludes the ability to render arbitrary planes through volumes (#3023) and add\nclipping planes to restrict rendering to a region of interest (#3140). For now,\nthese features are marked as <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">experimental</span></code> and the API around their use is\nlikely to change in future versions of napari. We’ve also greatly improved how\ndepth is handled across our visuals to fix some artifacts, see #3181 and\n#3265. Thanks to Alister Burt, Lorenzo Gaifas, and Kevin Yamauchi for this\nwork.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, some common operations are now much more accessible from\nthe GUI thanks to a new context menu on the layer list (#2556 and #3028) and\nbuttons for controlling image contrast limit scaling (#3022). Thanks to Talley\nLambert for these features!</p>\n<p>Read on below for the full list of new features, improvements, bug fixes, and\nmore!
