Monitoring.</p>\n<p>The perfmon module lets you instrument your code and visualize its run-time\nbehavior and timings in Chrome’s Tracing GUI.</p>\n<p>To enable perfmon define the env var NAPARI_PERFMON as follows:</p>\n<dl class=\"simple\">\n<dt>NAPARI_PERFMON=1</dt><dd><p>Activates perfmon, trace using Debug -&gt; Performance Trace menu.</p>\n</dd>\n<dt>NAPARI_PERFMON=/path/to/config.json</dt><dd><p>Configure perfmon using the config.json configuration. See the\nPerfmonConfig docs for the spec of the config file.</p>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"chrome-tracing\">\n<h2>Chrome Tracing<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#chrome-tracing\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>Chrome has a nice built-in performance tool called chrome://tracing. Chrome\ncan record traces of web applications. But the format is well-documented and\nanyone can create the files and use the nice GUI. And other programs accept\nthe format including:\n1) https://www.speedscope.app/ which does flamegraphs (Chrome doesn’t).\n2) Qt Creator’s performance tools.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"monkey-patching\">\n<h2>Monkey Patching<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#monkey-patching\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>The best way to add perf_timers is using the perfmon config file. You can\nlist which methods or functions you want to time, and a perf_timer will be\nmonkey-patched into each callable on startup. The monkey patching\nis done only if perfmon is enabled.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"trace-on-start\">\n<h2>Trace On Start<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#trace-on-start\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>Add a line to the config file like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div><p>“trace_file_on_start”: “/Path/to/my/trace.json”</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Perfmon will start tracing on startup. You must quit napari with the Quit\ncommand for napari to write trace file. See PerfmonConfig docs.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"manual-timing\">\n<h2>Manual Timing<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#manual-timing\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>You can also manually add “perf_timer” context objects and\n“add_counter_event()” and “add_instant_event()” functions to your code. All\nthree of these should be removed before merging the PR into main. While\nthey have almost zero overhead when perfmon is disabled, it’s still better\nnot to leave them in the code. Think of them as similar to debug prints.</p>\n<p class=\"rubric\">Classes</p>\n<table class=\"longtable docutils align-default\">\n<colgroup>\n<col style=\"width: 10%\">\n<col style=\"width: 90%\">\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"row-odd\"><td><p><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"napari.utils.perf.PerfEvent.html#napari.utils.perf.PerfEvent\" title=\"napari.utils.perf.PerfEvent\"><code class=\"xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">PerfEvent</span></code></a></p></td>\n<td><p>A performance related event: timer, counter, etc.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p class=\"rubric\">Functions</p>\n<dl class=\"py function\">\n<dt id=\"napari.utils.perf.add_counter_event\">\n<code class=\"sig-prename descclassname\"><span class=\"pre\">napari.utils.perf.</span></code><code class=\"sig-name descname\"><span class=\"pre\">add_counter_event</span></code><span class=\"sig-paren\">(</span><em class=\"sig-param\"><span class=\"n\"><span class=\"pre\">name</span></span></em>, <em class=\"sig-param\"><span class=\"o\"><span class=\"pre\">**</span></span><span class=\"n\"><span class=\"pre\">kwargs</span></span></em><span class=\"sig-paren\">)</span><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../_modules/napari/utils/perf/_timers.html#add_counter_event\"><span class=\"viewcode-link\"><span class=\"pre\">[source]</span></span></a><a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#napari.utils.perf.add_counter_event\" title=\"Permalink to this definition\">¶</a></dt>\n<dd><dl class=\"field-list simple\">\n<dt class=\"field-odd\">Return type</dt>\n<dd class=\"field-odd\"><p><code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">None</span></code></p>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd></dl>\n\n<dl class=\"py function\">\n<dt id=\"napari.utils.perf.add_instant_event\">\n<code class=\"sig-prename descclassname\"><span class=\"pre\">napari.utils.perf.</span></code><code class=\"sig-name descname\"><span class=\"pre\">add_instant_event</span></code><span class=\"sig-paren\">(</span><em class=\"sig-param\"><span class=\"n\"><span class=\"pre\">name</span></span></em>, <em class=\"sig-param\"><span class=\"o\"><span class=\"pre\">**</span></span><span class=\"n\"><span class=\"pre\">kwargs</span></span></em><span class=\"sig-paren\">)</span><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../_modules/napari/utils/perf/_timers.html#add_instant_event\"><span class=\"viewcode-link\"><span class=\"pre\">[source]</span></span></a><a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#napari.utils.perf.add_instant_event\" title=\"Permalink to this definition\">¶</a></dt>\n<dd><dl class=\"field-list simple\">\n<dt class=\"field-odd\">Return type</dt>\n<dd class=\"field-odd\"><p><code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">None</span></code></p>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd></dl>\n\n<dl class=\"py function\">\n<dt id=\"napari.utils.perf.block_timer\">\n<code class=\"sig-prename descclassname\"><span class=\"pre\">napari.utils.perf.</span></code><code class=\"sig-name descname\"><span class=\"pre\">block_timer</span></code><span class=\"sig-paren\">(</span><em class=\"sig-param\"><span class=\"n\"><span class=\"pre\">name</span></span></em>, <em class=\"sig-param\"><span class=\"n\"><span class=\"pre\">category</span></span><span class=\"o\"><span class=\"pre\">=</span></span><span class=\"default_value\"><span class=\"pre\">None</span></span></em>, <em class=\"sig-param\"><span class=\"n\"><span class=\"pre\">print_time</span></span><span class=\"o\"><span class=\"pre\">=</span></span><span class=\"default_value\"><span class=\"pre\">False</span></span></em>, <em class=\"sig-param\"><span class=\"o\"><span class=\"pre\">**</span></span><span class=\"n\"><span class=\"pre\">kwargs</span></span></em><span class=\"sig-paren\">)</span><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../_modules/napari/utils/perf/_timers.html#block_timer\"><span class=\"viewcode-link\"><span class=\"pre\">[source]</span></span></a><a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#napari.utils.perf.block_timer\" title=\"Permalink to this definition\">¶</a></dt>\n<dd><p>Time a block of code.</p>\n<p>block_timer can be used when perfmon is disabled.
