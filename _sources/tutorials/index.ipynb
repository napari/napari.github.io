    "\n",
    "**napari** is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.\n",
    "It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional\n",
    "images. It's built on top of `Qt` (for the GUI), `vispy` (for performant\n",
    "GPU-based rendering), and the scientific Python stack (e.g. `numpy`, `scipy`).\n",
    "It includes critical viewer features out-of-the-box, such as support for large\n",
    "multi-dimensional data, and layering and annotation. By integrating closely with\n",
    "the Python ecosystem, **napari** can be easily coupled to leading machine\n",
    "learning and image analysis tools (e.g. `scikit-image`, `scikit-learn`,\n",
    "`TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`), enabling more user-friendly automated analysis."
