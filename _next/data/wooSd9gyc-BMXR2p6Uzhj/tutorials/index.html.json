Here we’ve\nprovided a few tutorials to explore the main usage modes and methods of napari.\nBefore we dive in, let’s talk a bit about what napari actually is and why we’re\ndeveloping it.</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"what-is-napari\">\n<h2>what is napari?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#what-is-napari\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p><strong>napari</strong> is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.\nIt’s designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional\nimages. It’s built on top of <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Qt</span></code> (for the GUI), <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">vispy</span></code> (for performant\nGPU-based rendering), and the scientific Python stack (e.g. <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">numpy</span></code>, <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">scipy</span></code>).\nIt includes critical viewer features out-of-the-box, such as support for large\nmulti-dimensional data, and layering and annotation. By integrating closely with\nthe Python ecosystem, <strong>napari</strong> can be easily coupled to leading machine\nlearning and image analysis tools (e.g. <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">scikit-image</span></code>, <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">scikit-learn</span></code>,\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">TensorFlow</span></code>, <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">PyTorch</span></code>), enabling more user-friendly automated analysis.</p>\n<div class=\"cell docutils container\">\n<div class=\"cell_input docutils container\">\n<div class=\"highlight-ipython3 notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">napari</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">skimage.data</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">cells3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">cells</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">cells3d</span><span class=\"p\">()[</span><span class=\"mi\">30</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># get some data</span>\n<span class=\"n\">viewer</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">napari</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">view_image</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">cells</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">colormap</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s1\">'magma'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell_output docutils container\">\n<div class=\"output stderr highlight-myst-ansi notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span>Downloading file 'data/cells3d.tif' from 'https://gitlab.com/scikit-image/data/-/raw/master/cells3d.tif' to '/home/runner/.cache/scikit-image/0.18.3'.\n</pre></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"output stderr highlight-myst-ansi notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span>WARNING: QStandardPaths: XDG_RUNTIME_DIR not set, defaulting to '/tmp/runtime-runner'\n</pre></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell tag_hide-input docutils container\">\n<div class=\"cell_input docutils container\">\n<div class=\"highlight-ipython3 notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">napari.utils</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">nbscreenshot</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">nbscreenshot</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">viewer</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell_output docutils container\">\n<div class=\"output text_html\"><img src=\"/_data-images/w9U5ybFZ-0-BPwXGjdDg4qUXOfQwRU6rAdba8uZf4go.png\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<p>We’re developing <strong>napari</strong> in the open!
