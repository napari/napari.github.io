<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Labels</span></code> layer!</p>\n<p>This tutorial assumes you have already installed <strong>napari</strong>, know how to launch\nthe viewer, and are familiar with its layout. For help with installation see our\n<a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"installation.html\"><span class=\"doc std std-doc\">installation</span></a> tutorial. For help getting started with the\nviewer see our <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"getting_started.html\"><span class=\"doc std std-doc\">getting started</span></a> tutorial. For help\nunderstanding the organisation of the viewer, including things like the layers\nlist, the layer properties widgets, the layer control panels, and the dimension\nsliders see our <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"viewer.html\"><span class=\"doc std std-doc\">napari viewer</span></a> tutorial.</p>\n<p>This tutorial will teach you about the <strong>napari</strong> <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Labels</span></code> layer, including\nusing the layer to display the results of image segmentation analyses, and how\nto manually segment images using the paintbrush and fill buckets. At the end of\nthe tutorial you should understand how to add a labels image and edit it from\nthe GUI and from the console.</p>\n<p>The labels layer allows you to take an array of integers and display each\ninteger as a different random color, with the background color 0 rendered as\ntransparent.</p>\n<p>The <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Labels</span></code> layer is therefore especially useful for segmentation tasks where\neach pixel is assigned to a different class, as occurs in semantic segmentation,\nor where pixels corresponding to different objects all get assigned the same\nlabel, as occurs in instance segmentation.</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"a-simple-example\">\n<h2>a simple example<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#a-simple-example\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>You can create a new viewer and add an labels image in one go using the\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">napari.view_labels</span></code> method, or if you already have an existing viewer, you can\nadd a <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Labels</span></code> image to it using <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">viewer.add_labels</span></code>. The api of both methods is\nthe same. In these examples we’ll mainly use <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">add_labels</span></code> to overlay a <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Labels</span></code>\nimage onto on image.</p>\n<p>In this example of instance segmentation, we will find and segment each of the\ncoins in an image, assigning each one an integer label, and then overlay the\nresults on the original image as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"cell docutils container\">\n<div class=\"cell_input docutils container\">\n<div class=\"highlight-default

One of the tools that can be used for manual editing is the\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">paintbrush</span></code>, that can be made active from by clicking the paintbrush icon in\nthe layers control panel. Once the paintbrush is enabled, the pan and zoom\nfunctionality of the  viewer canvas gets disabled, and you can paint onto the\ncanvas. You can temporarily re-enable pan and zoom by pressing and holding the\nspacebar. This feature can be useful if you want to move around the labels layer\nas you paint.</p>\n<p>When you start painting the label that you are painting with, and the color that\nyou will see are determined by the selected label. Note there is no explicit\neraser tool, instead you just need to make the selected label 0 and then you are\neffectively painting with the background color. Remember you can use the color\npicker tool at any point to change the selected label.</p>\n<p>You can adjust the size of your paintbrush using the brush size slider, making\nit as small as a single pixel for incredibly detailed painting.</p>\n<p>If you have a multidimensional labels layer then your paintbrush will only edit\ndata in the visible slice by default; however, if you enable the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">n_dimensional</span></code>\nproperty and paintbrush then your paintbrush will extend out into neighbouring\nslices according to its size.</p>\n<p>You can quickly select the paintbrush by pressing the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">P</span></code> key when the labels\nlayer is selected.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"using-the-fill-bucket\">\n<h2>using the fill bucket<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#using-the-fill-bucket\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>Sometimes you might want to replace an entire label with a different label.

This property is located inside the layer widget in the\nlayers list and is represented by an eye icon.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"layer-opacity\">\n<h2>layer opacity<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#layer-opacity\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>All our layers support an opacity slider and <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">opacity</span></code> property that allow you\nto adjust the layer opacity between 0, fully invisible, and 1, fully visible.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"blending-layers\">\n<h2>blending layers<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#blending-layers\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>All our layers support three blending modes <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">translucent</span></code>, <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">additive</span></code>, and\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">opaque</span></code> that determine how the visuals for this layer get mixed with the\nvisuals from the other layers.</p>\n<p>An <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">opaque</span></code> layer renders all the other layers below it invisible and will fade\nto black as you decrease its opacity.</p>\n<p>The <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">translucent</span></code> setting will cause the layer to blend with the layers below it\nif you decrease its opacity but will fully block those layers if its opacity is</p>\n<ol class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>This is a reasonable default, useful for many applications.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The final blending mode <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">additive</span></code> will cause the layer to blend with the layers\nbelow even when it has full opacity. This mode is especially useful for\nvisualizing multiple layers at the same time.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"naming-layers\">\n<h2>naming layers<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#naming-layers\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>All our layers support a <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">name</span></code> property that can be set inside a text box\ninside the layer widget in the layers list. The name of each layer is forced\ninto being unique so that you can use the name to index into <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">viewer.layers</span></code> to\nretrieve the layer object.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"scaling-layers\">\n<h2>scaling layers<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#scaling-layers\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>All our layers support a <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">scale</span></code> property and keyword argument that will rescale\nthe layer multiplicatively according to the scale values (one for each\ndimension). This property can be particularly useful for viewing anisotropic\nvolumes where the size of the voxel in the z dimension might be different then\nthe size in the x and y dimensions.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"translating-layers\">\n<h2>translating layers<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#translating-layers\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>All our layers support a <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">translate</span></code> property and keyword argument that you can\nuse to offset a layer relative to the other layers, which could be useful if you\nare trying to overlay two layers for image registration purposes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"layer-metadata\">\n<h2>layer metadata<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#layer-metadata\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>All our layers also support a <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">metadata</span></code> property and keyword argument that you\ncan use to store an arbitrary metadata dictionary on the layer.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"next-steps\">\n<h2>next steps<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#next-steps\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>Hopefully, this tutorial has given you a detailed understanding of the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Labels</span></code>\nlayer, including how to create one and control its properties.
