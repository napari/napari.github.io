IMPORTANT NOTICE - PLEASE READ AND AGREE BEFORE DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING
OR USING

This Agreement is between you, or the company or other legal entity that you
represent and warrant you have the legal authority to bind, (each, &quot;You&quot; or
&quot;Your&quot;) and Intel Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, &quot;Intel&quot;)
regarding Your use of the Materials. By downloading, installing, copying or
using the Materials, You agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If
You do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, or do not have legal authority
or required age to agree to them, do not download, install, copy or use the
Materials.

1. LICENSE DEFINITIONS.

 A. &quot;Cloud Provider&quot; means a third party service provider offering a cloud-based
    platform, infrastructure, application or storage services, such as Microsoft
    Azure or Amazon Web Services, which You may only utilize to host the
    Materials subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 2.3 B.

 B. &quot;Derivative Work&quot; means a derivative work, as defined in 17 U.S.C. 101, of
    the Source Code.

 C. &quot;Executable Code&quot; means computer programming code in binary form suitable
    for machine execution by a processor without the intervening steps of
    interpretation or compilation.

 D. &quot;Materials&quot; mean the software, documentation, the software product serial
    number, and other collateral, including any updates, made available to You
    by Intel under this Agreement. Materials include Redistributables,
    Executable Code, Source Code, Sample Source Code, and Pre-Release Materials,
    but do not include Third Party Software.

 E. &quot;Pre-Release Materials&quot; mean the Materials, or portions of the Materials,
    that are identified (in the product release notes, on Intel&#39;s download
    website for the Materials or elsewhere) or labeled as pre-release,
    prototype, alpha or beta code and, as such, are deemed to be pre-release
    code (i) which may not be fully functional or tested and may contain bugs or
    errors; (ii) which Intel may substantially modify in its development of a
    production version; or (iii) for which Intel makes no assurances that it
    will ever develop or make a production version generally available.
    Pre-Release Materials are subject to the terms of Section 3.2.

 F. &quot;Reciprocal Open Source Software&quot; means any software that is subject to a
    license which requires that (i) it must be distributed in source code form;
    (ii) it must be licensed under the same open source license terms; and (iii)
    its derivative works must be licensed under the same open source license
    terms. Examples of this type of license are the GNU General Public License
    or the Mozilla Public License.

 G. &quot;Redistributables&quot; mean the files (if any) listed in the &quot;redist.txt,&quot;
    &quot;redist-rt.txt&quot; or similarly-named text files that may be included in the
    Materials. Redistributables include Sample Source Code.

 H. &quot;Sample Source Code&quot; means those portions of the Materials that are Source
    Code and are identified as sample code. Sample Source Code may not have been
    tested or validated by Intel and is provided purely as a programming example.

 I. &quot;Source Code&quot; means the software portion of the Materials provided in human
    readable format.

 J. &quot;Third Party Software&quot; mean the files (if any) listed in the
    &quot;third-party-software.txt&quot; or other similarly-named text file that may be
    included in the Materials for the applicable software. Third Party Software
    is subject to the terms of Section 2.2.

 K. &quot;Your Product&quot; means one or more applications, products or projects
    developed by or for You using the Materials.

2. LICENSE GRANTS.

2.1 License to the Materials. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    Agreement, Intel grants You a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-assignable,
    non-sublicensable, limited right and license under its copyrights, to:

 A. reproduce internally a reasonable number of copies of the Materials for Your
    personal or business use;

 B. use the Materials solely for Your personal or business use to develop Your
    Product, in accordance with the documentation included as part of the
    Materials;

 C. modify or create Derivative Works only of the Redistributables, or any
    portions, that are provided to You in Source Code;

 D. distribute (directly and through Your distributors, resellers, and other
    channel partners, if applicable), the Redistributables, including any
    modifications to or Derivative Works of the Redistributables or any portions
    made pursuant to Section 2.1.C subject to the following conditions:

  (1) Any distribution of the Redistributables must only be as part of Your
      Product which must add significant primary functionality different than
      that of the Redistributables themselves;

  (2) You must only distribute the Redistributables originally provided to You
      by Intel only in Executable Code subject to a license agreement that
      prohibits reverse engineering, decompiling or disassembling the
      Redistributables;

  (3) This distribution right includes a limited right to sublicense only the
      Intel copyrights in the Redistributables and only to the extent necessary
      to perform, display, and distribute the Redistributables (including Your
      modifications and Derivative Works of the Redistributables provided in
      Source Code) solely as incorporated in Your Product; and

  (4) You: (i) will be solely responsible to Your customers for any update,
      support obligation or other obligation or liability which may arise from
      the distribution of Your Product, (ii) will not make any statement that
      Your Product is &quot;certified&quot; or that its performance is guaranteed by Intel
      or its suppliers, (iii) will not use Intel&#39;s or its suppliers&#39; names or
      trademarks to market Your Product, (iv) will comply with any additional
      restrictions which are included in the text files with the
      Redistributables and in Section 3 below, (v) will indemnify, hold
      harmless, and defend Intel and its suppliers from and against any claims
      or lawsuits, costs, damages, and expenses, including attorney&#39;s fees, that
      arise or result from (a) Your modifications or Derivative Works of the
      Materials or (b) Your distribution of Your Product.

2.2 Third Party Software. Third Party Software, even if included with the
    distribution of the Materials, may be governed by separate license terms,
    including without limitation, third party license terms, open source
    software notices and terms, and/or other Intel software license terms. These
    separate license terms solely govern Your use of the Third Party Software.

2.3 Third Party Use.

 A. If You are an entity, Your contractors may use the Materials under the
    license specified in Section 2, provided: (i) their use of the Materials is
    solely on behalf of and in support of Your business, (ii) they agree to the
    terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (iii) You are solely responsible
    for their use, misuse or disclosure of the Materials.

 B. You may utilize a Cloud Provider to host the Materials for You, provided:
    (i) the Cloud Provider may only host the Materials for Your exclusive use
   and may not use the Materials for any other purpose whatsoever, including the
   restriction set forth in Section 3.1(xi); (ii) the Cloud Provider&#39;s use of
   the Materials must be solely on behalf of and in support of Your Product, and
   (iii) You will indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Intel and its suppliers
   from and against any claims or lawsuits, costs, damages, and expenses,
   including attorney&#39;s fees, that arise or result from Your Cloud Provider&#39;s
   use, misuse or disclosure of the Materials.

3. LICENSE CONDITIONS.

3.1 Restrictions. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, You may NOT:
    (i) use, reproduce, disclose, distribute, or publicly display the
    Materials; (ii) share, publish, rent or lease the Materials to any third
    party; (iii) assign this Agreement or transfer the Materials; (iv) modify,
    adapt, or translate the Materials in whole or in part; (v) reverse engineer,
    decompile, or disassemble the Materials, or otherwise attempt to derive the
    source code for the software; (vi) work around any technical limitations in
    the Materials; (vii) distribute, sublicense or transfer any Source Code,
    modifications or Derivative Works of any Source Code to any third party;
    (viii) remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Intel or its
    suppliers in the Materials; (ix) include the Redistributables in malicious,
    deceptive, or unlawful programs or products or use the Materials in any way
    that is against the law; (x) modify, create a Derivative Work, link, or
    distribute the Materials so that any part of it becomes Reciprocal Open
    Source Software; (xi) use the Materials directly or indirectly for SaaS
    services or service bureau purposes (i.e., a service that allows use of or
    access to the Materials by a third party as part of that service, such as
    the salesforce.com service business model).

3.2 Pre-Release Materials. If You receive Pre-Release Materials, You may
    reproduce a reasonable number of copies and use the Pre-Release Materials
    for evaluation and testing purposes only. You may not (i) modify or
    incorporate the Pre-Release Materials into Your Product; (ii) continue to
    use the Pre-Release Materials once a commercial version is released; or
    (iii) disclose to any third party any benchmarks, performance results, or
    other information relating to the Pre-Release Materials. Intel may waive
    these restrictions in writing at its sole discretion; however, if You decide
    to use the Pre-Release Materials in Your Product (even with Intel&#39;s waiver),
    You acknowledge and agree that You are fully responsible for any and all
    issues that result from such use.

3.3 Safety-Critical, and Life-Saving Applications; Indemnity. The Materials may
    provide information relevant to safety-critical applications
    (&quot;Safety-Critical Applications&quot;) to allow compliance with functional safety
    standards or requirements. You acknowledge and agree that safety is Your
    responsibility. To the extent You use the Materials to create, or as part
    of, products used in Safety-Critical Applications, it is Your responsibility
    to design, manage, and ensure that there are system-level safeguards to
    anticipate, monitor, and control system failures, and You agree that You are
    solely responsible for all applicable regulatory standards and
    safety-related requirements concerning Your use of the Materials in Safety
    Critical Applications.

    Should You use the Materials for Safety-Critical Applications or in any type
    of a system or application in which the failure of the Materials could
    create a situation where personal injury or death may occur (e.g., medical

PlayReady-protected content for reasons including but not limited to (i) if a breach or potential breach of PlayReady technology occurs, (ii) proactive
robustness enhancement, and (iii) if Content owners require the revocation because the software fails to properly enforce restrictions on content usage.
Revocation should not affect unprotected content or content protected by other content access technologies.  Content owners may require you to upgrade
PlayReady to access their content.  If you decline an upgrade, you will not be able to access content that requires the upgrade and may not be able to install
other operating system updates or upgrades.
            viii. Package Managers. The software may include package managers, like NuGet, that give you the option to download other Microsoft and third
party software packages to use with your application. Those packages are under their own licenses, and not this agreement. Microsoft does not distribute,
license or provide any warranties for any of the third party packages.
            ix. Font Components. While the software is running, you may use its fonts to display and print content. You may only embed fonts in content as
permitted by the embedding restrictions in the fonts; and temporarily download them to a printer or other output device to help print content.

cultural or social identity of that natural person.
        b. Collecting Personal Information using Packaged and Add-on APIs.  If you use any API to collect personal information from the software, you must
comply with all laws and regulations applicable to your use of the data accessed through APIs including without limitation laws related to privacy, biometric
data, data protection, and confidentiality of communications. Your use of the software is conditioned upon implementing and maintaining appropriate
protections and measures for your applications and services, and that includes your responsibility to the data obtained through the use of APIs. For the data
you obtained through any APIs, you must:
            i. obtain all necessary consents before collecting and using data and only use the data for the limited purposes to which the user consented,
including any consent to changes in use;
            ii. In the event you’re storing data, ensure that data is kept up to date and implement corrections, restrictions to data, or the deletion of data
as updated through packaged or add-on APIs or upon user request if required by applicable law;
            iii. implement proper retention and deletion policies, including deleting all data when as directed by your users or as required by applicable
law; and
            iv. maintain and comply with a written statement available to your customers that describes your privacy practices regarding data and information
you collect, use and that you share with any third parties.
        c. Location Framework. The software may contain a location framework component or APIs that enable support of location services in programs.
Programs that receive device location must comply with the requirements related to the Location Service APIs as described in the Microsoft Store Policies
(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/windows/agreements/store-policies).   If you choose to collect device location data outside of the control of Windows
system settings, you must obtain legally sufficient consent for your data practices, and such practices must comply with all other applicable laws and
regulations.
        d. Security.  If your application or service collects, stores or transmits personal information, it must do so securely, by using modern cryptography
methods.
    4. BACKUP COPY. You may make one backup copy of the software. You may use it only to reinstall the software.
    5. DOCUMENTATION. Any person that has valid access to your computer or internal network may copy and use the documentation for your internal, reference
purposes.
    6. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other
rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing
so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not
    • Except for the Microsoft .NET Framework, you must obtain Microsoft&#39;s prior written approval to disclose to a third party the results of any benchmark
test of the software.
    • work around any technical limitations in the software;
    • reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;
    • make more copies of the software than specified in this agreement or allowed by applicable law, despite this limitation;
    • publish the software for others to copy;
    • rent, lease or lend the software;
    • transfer the software or this agreement to any third party; or
    • use the software for commercial software hosting services.
    7. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export
laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, see
www.microsoft.com/exporting.
    8. SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support services for it.
    9. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire
agreement for the software and support services.
    10. INDEPENDENT PARTIES.  Microsoft and you are independent contractors. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed as creating an employer-employee
relationship, processor-subprocessor relationship, a partnership, or a joint venture between the parties.
    11. APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. If you acquired the software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you
live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other
claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of laws principles. If you acquired the software in any
other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King
County, Washington for all disputes heard in court. If not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King
County, Washington for all disputes heard in court.
    12. LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with
respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your
country do not permit it to do so.
    13. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The software is licensed “as-is.” You bear the risk of using it. Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or
conditions. You may have additional consumer rights or statutory guarantees under your local laws which this agreement cannot change. To the extent permitted
under your local laws, Microsoft excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.
FOR AUSTRALIA – You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in these terms is intended to affect those rights.
    14. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. You can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00. You cannot
recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages.
This limitation applies to
    • anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
    • claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by
applicable law.
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you
because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

Please note: As this software is distributed in Quebec, Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.
Remarque : Ce logiciel étant distribué au Québec, Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français.

LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES DOMMAGES. Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une indemnisation
en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $ US. Vous ne pouvez prétendre à aucune indemnisation pour les autres dommages, y compris les dommages
spéciaux, indirects ou accessoires et pertes de bénéfices.
Crete limitation concern:

Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître l’éventualité d’un tel dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la
limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-dessus
ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard.
EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent
contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.

MICROSOFT VISUAL C++ 2019 RUNTIME

These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or
based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. They apply to
the software named above. The terms also apply to any Microsoft services
or updates for the software, except to the extent those have different
terms.

IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.

-   INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.

-   You may install and use any number of copies of the software.

-   TERMS FOR SPECIFIC COMPONENTS.

    -   MICROSOFT PLATFORMS. The software may include components from
        Microsoft Windows; Microsoft Windows Server; Microsoft SQL
        Server; Microsoft Exchange; Microsoft Office; and Microsoft
        SharePoint. These components are governed by separate agreements
        and their own product support policies, as described in the
        Microsoft “Licenses” folder accompanying the software, except
        that, if license terms for those components are also included in
        the associated installation directory, those license terms
        control.

    -   THIRD PARTY COMPONENTS.  The software may include third party
        components with separate legal notices or governed by other
        agreements, as may be described in the ThirdPartyNotices file(s)
        accompanying the software.

-   SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement
    only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves
    all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights
    despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly
    permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any
    technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it
    in certain ways. You may not

    -   work around any technical limitations in the software;

    -   reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or
        otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the software
        except, and only to the extent required by third party licensing
        terms governing the use of certain open source components that
        may be included in the software;

    -   remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or
        its suppliers in the software;

    -   use the software in any way that is against the law; or

    -   share, publish, rent or lease the software, or provide the
        software as a stand-alone offering for others to use, or
        transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.

-   EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and
    international export laws and regulations that apply to the
    software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and
    end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit
    www.microsoft.com/exporting.

-   SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not
    provide support services for it.

-   ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements,
    updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use,
    are the entire agreement for the software and support services.

-   APPLICABLE LAW. If you acquired the software in the United States,
    Washington law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of
    this agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to
    all other claims. If you acquired the software in any other country,
    its laws apply.

-   CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes
    certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer
    rights, under the laws of your state or country. Separate and apart
    from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with
    respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This
    agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your
    state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you
    acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory
    country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:

    -   AUSTRALIA. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian
        Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect
        those rights.

    -   CANADA. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop
        receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature,
        disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you
        re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume
        checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the
        software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify
        how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.

    -   GERMANY AND AUSTRIA.

        (i) WARRANTY. The properly licensed software will perform
        substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that
        accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual
        guarantee in relation to the licensed software.

        (ii) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. In case of intentional conduct,
        gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as
        well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury,
        Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.

    -   Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be
        liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such
        material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which
        facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of
        which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the
        compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called
        &quot;cardinal obligations&quot;). In other cases of slight negligence,
        Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.

-   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR
    THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES,
    GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL
    LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

-   LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM
    MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00.
    YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST
    PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

    This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software,
    services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or
    third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract,
    breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability,
    negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

    It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about
    the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion
    may not apply to you because your country may not allow the
    exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other
    damages.
