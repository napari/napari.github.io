They\nhave shown they can be trusted to maintain napari with care. Becoming a\ncore developer allows contributors to merge approved pull requests, cast votes\nfor and against merging a pull-request, and be involved in deciding major\nchanges to the API, and thereby more easily carry on with their project related\nactivities. Core developers appear as organization members on the napari\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/orgs/napari/people\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GitHub organization</a> and are on our\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/orgs/napari/teams/core-devs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">@napari/core-devs</a> GitHub team. Core\ndevelopers are expected to review code contributions while adhering to the\n<a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../developers/core_dev_guide.html#core-dev-guide\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">core developer guide</span></a>. New core developers can be nominated\nby any existing core developer, and for details on that process see our core\ndeveloper guide.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"steering-council\">\n<h3>Steering Council<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#steering-council\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h3>\n<p>The Steering Council (SC) members are core developers who have additional\nresponsibilities to ensure the smooth running of the project. SC members are\nexpected to participate in strategic planning, approve changes to the\ngovernance model, and make decisions about funding granted to the project\nitself. (Funding to community members is theirs to pursue and manage). The\npurpose of the SC is to ensure smooth progress from the big-picture\nperspective. Changes that impact the full project require analysis informed by\nlong experience with both the project and the larger ecosystem. When the core\ndeveloper community (including the SC members) fails to reach such a consensus\nin a reasonable timeframe, the SC is the entity that resolves the issue.</p>\n<p>Members of the steering council also have the “owner” role within the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/napari\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">napari GitHub organization</a>\nand are ultimately responsible for managing the napari GitHub account, the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/napari_imaging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">@napari_imaging</a>\ntwitter account, the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://napari.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">napari website</a>, and other similar napari owned resources.</p>\n<p>The steering council is currently fixed in size to three members. This number may be increased in\nthe future, but will always be an odd number to ensure a simple majority vote outcome\nis always possible. The initial steering council of napari consists of</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/jni\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Juan Nunez-Iglesias</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/royerloic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Loic Royer</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/sofroniewn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nicholas Sofroniew</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The SC membership is revisited every January. SC members who do\nnot actively engage with the SC duties are expected to resign. New members are\nadded by nomination by a core developer. Nominees should have demonstrated\nlong-term, continued commitment to the project and its <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"mission_and_values.html#mission-and-values\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">mission and values</span></a>. A\nnomination will result in discussion that cannot take more than a month and\nthen admission to the SC by consensus. During that time deadlocked votes of the SC will\nbe postponed until the new member has joined and another vote can be held.</p>\n<p>The napari steering council may be contacted at <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">napari-steering-council@googlegroups.com</span></code>.\nOr via the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/orgs/napari/teams/steering-council\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">@napari/steering-council</a> GitHub team.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"decision-making-process\">\n<h2>Decision making process<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#decision-making-process\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>Decisions about the future of the project are made through discussion with all\nmembers of the community.

The group\ntries to find a resolution that has no open objections among core developers.\nCore developers are expected to distinguish between fundamental objections to a\nproposal and minor perceived flaws that they can live with, and not hold up the\ndecision-making process for the latter.  If no option can be found without\nobjections, the decision is escalated to the SC, which will itself use\nconsensus seeking to come to a resolution. In the unlikely event that there is\nstill a deadlock, the proposal will move forward if it has the support of a\nsimple majority of the SC.</p>\n<p>Decisions (in addition to adding core developers and SC membership as above)\nare made according to the following rules:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p><strong>Minor documentation changes</strong>, such as typo fixes, or addition / correction of a\nsentence, require approval by a core developer <em>and</em> no disagreement or requested\nchanges by a core developer on the issue or pull request page (lazy\nconsensus).
