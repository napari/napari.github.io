will use napari (requires version 0.3.2 or greater) to make a simple GUI application for annotating points in videos.\nThis GUI could be useful for making annotations required to train algorithms for markless tracking of animals (e.g., <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">DeepLabCut</a>).\nIn this tutorial, we will cover creating and interacting with a Points layer with properties (i.e., labels for the points), connecting custom UI elements to events, and creating custom keybindings.</p>\n<p>At the end of this tutorial, we will have created a GUI for annotating points in videos that we can simply call by:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight-python notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span
