dask</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">    arrays and prepares some optimizations if so.</span>\n\n<span class=\"sd\">    When a delayed dask array is given to napari, there are couple things that</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">    need to be done to optimize performance.</span>\n\n<span class=\"sd\">    1. Opportunistic caching needs to be enabled, such that we don't recompute</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">       (or \"re-read\") data that has already been computed or read.</span>\n\n<span class=\"sd\">    2. Dask task fusion must be turned off to prevent napari from triggering</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">       new io on data that has already been read from disk. For example, with a</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">       4D timelapse of 3D stacks, napari may actually *re-read* the entire 3D</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">       tiff file every time the Z plane index is changed.
