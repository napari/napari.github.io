For help with installation see our\n<a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"installation.html\"><span class=\"doc std std-doc\">installation</span></a> tutorial. For help getting started with the\nviewer see our <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"getting_started.html\"><span class=\"doc std std-doc\">getting started</span></a> tutorial. For help\nunderstanding the organisation of the viewer, including things like the layers\nlist, the layer properties widgets, the layer control panels, and the dimension\nsliders see our <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"viewer.html\"><span class=\"doc std std-doc\">napari viewer</span></a> tutorial.</p>\n<p>This tutorial will teach you about the <strong>napari</strong> <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Surface</span></code> layer, including how\nto display surface data and edit the properties of surfaces like the contrast,\nopacity, colormaps and blending mode. At the end of the tutorial you should\nunderstand how to add and manipulate surfaces both from the GUI and from the\nconsole.</p>\n<p>The surface layer allows you to display a precomputed surface mesh that is\ndefined by an NxD array of N vertices in D coordinates, an Mx3 integer array of\nthe indices of the triangles making up the faces of the surface, and a length N\nlist of values to associate with each vertex to use alongside a colormap.</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"a-simple-example\">\n<h2>a simple example<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#a-simple-example\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>You can create a new viewer and add a surface in one go using the\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">napari.view_surface</span></code> method, or if you already have an existing viewer, you can\nadd an image to it using <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">viewer.add_surface</span></code>. The api of both methods is the\nsame. In these examples we’ll mainly use <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">view_surface</span></code>.</p>\n<p>A simple example of viewing a surface is as follows:</p>\n<div
