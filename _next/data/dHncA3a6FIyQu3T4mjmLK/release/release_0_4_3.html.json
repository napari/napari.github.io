interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.\nIt’s designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional\nimages. It’s built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based\nrendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy).</p>\n<p>For more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website:\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/napari/napari\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://github.com/napari/napari</a></p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"highlights\">\n<h2>Highlights<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#highlights\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>In this release we’ve added two new analysis and GUI focused <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://napari.org/docs/dev/plugins/hook_specifications.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">hook specifications</a> for our plugin developers (#2080).</p>\n<p>The first one <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">napari_experimental_provide_function_widget</span></code> allows you to provide a function or list of functions that we\nwill turn into a GUI element using using <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://napari.org/magicgui/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">magicgui</a>. This hook spec leverages the newly added and the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">viewer.window.add_function_widget</span></code> method (#1856) and the newly recently released <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">0.2</span></code> series of magicgui which seperates out an abstract function and widget API from its Qt backend. These functions can take in and return napari layer, allowing you to\nprovide analysis functionality to napari without having to write GUI code.</p>\n<p>The second one <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">napari_experimental_provide_dock_widget</span></code> allows you to provide a QWidget or list of QWidgets that we will instantiate with access to the napari viewer and add to the GUI. This hook spec leverages our <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">viewer.window.add_dock_widget</span></code> method, and allows you to provide highly customized GUI elements that could include additional plots or interactivity.</p>\n<p>Both of these hook specs are marked as <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">experimental</span></code> as we’re likely to evolve the API here in response to user needs, and we’re excited to get early feedback from plugin developers on them.</p>\n<p>In this release we also seperate out more of the Qt functionality from napari making it easier to run headless (#2039, #2055). We also added a <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">napari.run</span></code> method as an alternative to using the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">napari.gui_qt</span></code> context manager (#2056).</p>\n<p>We’ve also made good progress on our <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">experimental</span></code> support for an octree system for rendering large 2D multiscale images. You can try this functionality setting <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">NAPARI_OCTREE=1</span></code> as an environment variable. See our <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://napari.org/guides/stable/rendering.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">asynchronous rendering guide</a> for more details on how to use the octree and its current limitations.</p>\n<p>Finally we’ve added our <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://napari.org/roadmaps/0_4.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">0.4 series roadmap</a> and a <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://napari.org/roadmaps/0_3_retrospective.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">retrospective on our 0.3 roadmap</a>!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"new-features\">\n<h2>New Features<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#new-features\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>Add support for function widgets (#1856)</p></li>\n<li><p>Gui hookspecs (#2080)</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"improvements\">\n<h2>Improvements<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#improvements\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>Use evented dataclass for dims (#1917)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add information about screen resolution (#1957)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add asdict and update to evented dataclass (#1966)</p></li>\n<li><p>async-30: ChunkLoader Stats (#1972)</p></li>\n<li><p>async-31: Fix Monitor Feature Toggle (#1975)</p></li>\n<li><p>octree: Fix float64 and check downscale ratio (#1976)</p></li>\n<li><p>async-32: Faster Octree Rendering (#1977)</p></li>\n<li><p>async-33: Cleanup QtPoll and Tiled Visuals (#1980)</p></li>\n<li><p>async-34: Octree Performance (#1989)</p></li>\n<li><p>async-35: OctreeDisplayOptions (#1991)</p></li>\n<li><p>async-36: New OctreeChunkLoader (#1992)</p></li>\n<li><p>async-37: Multilevel Rendering (#1995)</p></li>\n<li><p>async-38: Better Multilevel Rendering (#1997)</p></li>\n<li><p>async-39: Better Config and Remove Qt Code (#1999)</p></li>\n<li><p>Improve label paint lag (#2000)</p></li>\n<li><p>async-40: Shared Memory Resources (#2004)</p></li>\n<li><p>async-41: Better Octree Performance (#2010)</p></li>\n<li><p>Start magicgui apps too (#2016)</p></li>\n<li><p>async-42: New LoaderPool and remove ChunkKey (#2025)</p></li>\n<li><p>Two small path improvements (#2030)</p></li>\n<li><p>Cleanup dockwidget removal (#2036)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add a MousemapProvider (#2040)</p></li>\n<li><p>Cleanup warnings in tests (#2041)</p></li>\n<li><p>async-43: New LoaderPoolGroup (#2049)</p></li>\n<li><p>Complete qt isolation (#2055)</p></li>\n<li><p>Create QApplication on demand in viewer.Window, add napari.run function (#2056)</p></li>\n<li><p>Remove global app logic from Window init (#2065)</p></li>\n<li><p>async-45: Docs and Cleanup (#2067)</p></li>\n<li><p>Better bound magicgui viewer (#2100)</p></li>\n<li><p>reduce call of _extent_data in layer (#2106)</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"bug-fixes\">\n<h2>Bug Fixes<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#bug-fixes\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>Fix append and remove from layerlist (#1955)</p></li>\n<li><p>Change label tooltip checkbox (#1978)</p></li>\n<li><p>Fix cursor size (#1983)</p></li>\n<li><p>Fix layer removing by disconnecting each event individually (#1984)</p></li>\n<li><p>Compatibility with magicgui v0.2.0 (#1994)</p></li>\n<li><p>Skip rounding of numbers when comparing data slice (#2017)</p></li>\n<li><p>Fix InitVar problem (#2023)</p></li>\n<li><p>Fix channel_axis for affine transforms in add_image (#2026)</p></li>\n<li><p>Fix typos in theme event and vispy camera (#2034)</p></li>\n<li><p>Fix magicgui test funcs (#2044)</p></li>\n<li><p>Fix magicwidget.native detection of “empty” widgets (#2046)</p></li>\n<li><p>async-44: Fix Pixel Shift Bug (#2052)</p></li>\n<li><p>Fix missing console widget (#2063)</p></li>\n<li><p>Save app reference in Window init (#2076)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add deprecated parameters for updating theme (#2074)</p></li>\n<li><p>Coerce name before layer is added to layerlist (#2087)</p></li>\n<li><p>Fix stale data in magicgui <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">*Data</span></code> parameters (#2088)</p></li>\n<li><p>Make dock widgets non-tabbed (#2096)</p></li>\n<li><p>Fix overly strict magic kwargs (#2099)</p></li>\n<li><p>Undo calling pyrcc with python sys.executable (#2102)</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"api-changes\">\n<h2>API Changes<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#api-changes\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>The <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">axis</span></code> parameter is no longer present on the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">current_step</span></code>, <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">range</span></code>, or <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">axis_labels</span></code> events.
