Drawing chunks\nwhich are more detailed that this will look fine, the graphics card will\ndownsample them to the screen resolution, but it’s not efficient to use\nhigher resolution chunks than are needed. Meanwhile drawing chunks that are\ncoarser than the ideal level will look blurry, but it’s much better than\ndrawing nothing.</p>\n<p>The decision about what level of detail to use is made by the\n<code class=\"xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">OctreeLoader</span></code>\nclass and its method\n<code class=\"xref py py-meth docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">get_drawable_chunks()</span></code>.\nThere are many different approaches one could take here as far as what to\ndraw when. Today we are doing something reasonable but it could potentially\nbe improved. In addition to deciding what level of detail to draw for each\nideal chunk, the class initiates asynchronous loads with the\n<code class=\"xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">ChunkLoader</span></code> for\nchunks it wants to draw in the future.</p>\n<p>The loader will only use chunks from a higher resolution if they are\nalready being drawn. For example when zooming out. However, it will never\ninitiate loads on higher resolution chunks, since it’s better off loading\nand drawing the ideal chunks.</p>\n<p>The loader will load lower resolution chunks in some cases. Although this\ncan slightly delay when the ideal chunks are loaded, it’s a very quick way\nto get reasonable looking “coverage” of the area of interest. Often data\nfrom one or two levels up isn’t even that noticeably degraded. This table\nshows how many ideal chunks are “covered” by a chunk at a higher level:</p>\n<table class=\"colwidths-auto docutils align-default\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"row-odd\"><th class=\"text-align:right head\"><p>Levels Above Ideal</p></th>\n<th class=\"text-align:right head\"><p>Coverage</p></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"row-even\"><td class=\"text-align:right\"><p>1</p></td>\n<td class=\"text-align:right\"><p>4</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-odd\"><td class=\"text-align:right\"><p>2</p></td>\n<td class=\"text-align:right\"><p>16</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-even\"><td class=\"text-align:right\"><p>3</p></td>\n<td class=\"text-align:right\"><p>64</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Although data 3 levels above will be quite blurry, it’s pretty amazing you\ncan load one chunk and it will cover 64 ideal chunks.

The way\n<code class=\"xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">TiledImageVisual</span></code>\nworks today is the\n<code class=\"xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">OctreeLoader</span></code>\npotentially passes the visual tiles of various sizes, from different levels\nof the Octree. The tiles are rendered on top of each other from largest\n(coarsest level) to smallest (finest level). This is a nice trick so that\nbigger tiles provide “coverage” for an area, while the smaller tiles add\ndetail only where that data has been loaded.</p>\n<p>However, this breaks blending and opacity. We draw multiple tiles on top of\neach other, so the image is blending with itself. One solution which is\nkind of a big change is keep\n<code class=\"xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">TiledImageVisual</span></code>\nfor the generic “tiled” case, but introduce a new <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">OctreeVisual</span></code> that\nknows about the Octree. It can walk up and down the Octree chopping up\nlarger tiles to make sure we do not render anything on top of anything\nelse.</p>\n<p>Until we do that, we could punt on making things look correct while loads\nare in progress. We could even highlight the fact that a tile has not been\nfully loaded (purposely making it look different until the data is fully\nloaded). Aside from blending, this would address a common complaint with\ntiled image viewers: you often can’t tell if the data is still being\nloaded. This could be a big issue for scientific uses, you don’t want\npeople drawing the wrong conclusions from the data.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"time-series-multiscale\">\n<h4>Time-series Multiscale<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#time-series-multiscale\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h4>\n<p>To make time-series multiscale work should not be too hard.

For starters we probably need\nto stop creating the “extra” downsampled levels, as described in <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#future-work-atlas-2d\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Future Work: Extending TextureAtlas2D</span></a>. We need to make sure constructing and\ntearing down the Octree is fast enough, and make sure loads for the\nprevious slices are canceled and everything is cleaned up.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"future-work-extending-textureatlas2d\">\n<span id=\"future-work-atlas-2d\"></span><h3>Future Work: Extending TextureAtlas2D<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#future-work-extending-textureatlas2d\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h3>\n<p>We could improve our\n<code class=\"xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">TextureAtlas2D</span></code> class in\na number of ways:</p>\n<ol class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>Support setting the atlas’s full texture size on the fly.</p></li>\n<li><p>Support setting the atlas’s tile size on the fly.</p></li>\n<li><p>Support a mix of tiles sizes in one atlas.</p></li>\n<li><p>Allow an atlas to have more than one backing texture.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>One reason to consider these changes is so we could support “large tiles”\nin certain cases. Often the coarsest level of multi-scale data “in the\nwild” is much bigger than one of our (256, 256) tiles. Today we solve that\nby creating additional Octree levels, downsampling the data until the\ncoarsest level fits within a single tile.</p>\n<p>If we could support multiple tiles sizes and multiple backing textures, we\ncould potentially have “interior tiles” which were small, but then allow\nlarge root tiles. Graphics cards can handle pretty big textures. A layer\nthat’s (100000, 100000) obviously needs to be broken into tiles, b¡ut a\nlayer that’s (4096, 4096) really does not need to be broken into tiles.\nThat could be a single large tile.</p>\n<p>Long term it would be nice if we did not have to support two image classes:\n<a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../api/stable/napari.layers.Image.html#napari.layers.Image\" title=\"napari.layers.Image\"><code class=\"xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Image</span></code></a> and\n<code class=\"xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">OctreeImage</span></code>.\nMaintaining two code paths and two sets of visuals will become tiresome and\nlead to discrepancies and bugs.</p>\n<p>Instead, it would be nice if\n<code class=\"xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">OctreeImage</span></code> became\nthe only image class. One image class to rule them all. For that to happen,\nthough, we need to render small images just as efficiently as the\n<a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../api/stable/napari.layers.Image.html#napari.layers.Image\" title=\"napari.layers.Image\"><code class=\"xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Image</span></code></a> class does today. We do not want\nOctree rendering to worsen cases which work well today. To keep today’s\nperformance for smaller images we probably need to add support for variable\nsize tiles.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"future-work-level-zero-only-octrees\">\n<h3>Future Work: Level Zero Only Octrees<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#future-work-level-zero-only-octrees\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h3>\n<p>In issue <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/1300\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">#1300</a> it takes\n1500ms to switch slices. There we are rendering a (16384, 16384) image that\nis entirely in RAM. The delay is not from loading into RAM, it’s already in\nRAM, the delay is from transferring all that data to VRAM in one big gulp.</p>\n<p>The image is not a multi-scale image. So can we turn it into a muli-scale\nimage? Generally we’ve found downsampling to create multi-scale image\nlayers is slow. So the question is how can we draw this large image without\nhanging? One idea is we could create an Octree that only has a level zero\nand no downsampled levels.</p>\n<p>This is an option because chopping up a <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">numpy</span></code> array into tiles is very\nfast. This chopping up phase is really just creating a bunch of “views”\ninto the single existing array. So creating a level zero Octree should be\nvery fast. For there we can use our existing Octree code and our existing\n<code class=\"xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">TiledImageVisual</span></code>\nto transfer over one tile at a time without hurting the frame rate.</p>\n<p>The insight here is our Octree code is really two things, one is an Octree\nbut two is a tiled or chunked image, basically a flat image chopped into a\ngrid of tiles. How would this look to the user? With this approach\nswitching slices would be similar to panning and zooming a multiscale\nOctree image, you’d see the new tiles loading in over time, but the\nframerate would not tank, and you could switch slices at any time.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"future-work-caching\">\n<h3>Future Work: Caching<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#future-work-caching\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h3>\n<p>Basically no work has gone into caching or memory management for Octree\ndata. It’s very likely there are leaks and extended usage will run out of\nmemory. This hasn’t been addressed because using Octree for long periods of\ntime is just now becoming possible.</p>\n<p>One caching issue is figuring out how to combine the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">ChunkCache</span></code> with\nDasks’s built-in caching. We probably want to keep the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">ChunkCache</span></code> for\nrendering non-Dask arrays? But when using Dask, we defer to its cache? We\ncertainly don’t want to cache the data in both places.</p>\n<p>Another issue is whether to cache <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">OctreeChunks</span></code> or tiles in the visual,\nbeyond just caching the raw data. If re-creating both is fast enough, the\nsimpler thing is evict them fully when a chunk falls out of view. And\nre-create them if it comes back in view. It’s simplest to keep nothing but\nwhat we are currently drawing.</p>\n<p>However if that’s not fast enough, we could have a MRU cache of\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">OctreeChunks</span></code> and tiles in VRAM, so that reviewing the same data is\nnearly instant. This is adding complexity, but the performance might be\nworth it.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n    <script type=\"text/x-thebe-config\">\n    {\n        requestKernel: true,\n        binderOptions: {\n            repo: \"binder-examples/jupyter-stacks-datascience\",\n            ref: \"master\",\n        },\n        codeMirrorConfig: {\n            theme: \"abcdef\",\n            mode: \"python\"\n        },\n        kernelOptions: {\n            kernelName: \"python3\",\n            path: \"./guides/stable\"\n        },\n        predefinedOutput: true\n    }\n    </script>\n    <script>kernelName = 'python3'</script>\n      ","pageHeaders":[{"href":"#napari-async","text":"NAPARI_ASYNC"},{"href":"#napari-octree","text":"NAPARI_OCTREE"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
