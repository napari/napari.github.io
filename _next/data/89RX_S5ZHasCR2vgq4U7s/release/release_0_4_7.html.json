interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.\nIt’s designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional\nimages. It’s built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based\nrendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy).</p>\n<p>For more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website:\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/napari/napari\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://github.com/napari/napari</a></p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"highlights\">\n<h2>Highlights<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#highlights\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>After nearly a year of planning, thanks to help from the fine folks at\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://labs.quansight.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Quansight</a>, napari now has a preferences dialog!\n(#2211). It’s a little sparse at the moment but we look forward to meeting all\nyour customization needs!</p>\n<p>Thanks to Matthias Bussonnier and Talley Lambert, we’ve also improved our\nnotification handling and can now show tracebacks in our error notifcations in\nthe GUI!</p>\n<p>You can now use PyData/Sparse arrays as labels layers, thanks to work by Draga\nDoncila Pop (across both napari and sparse itself) and Juan Nunez-Iglesias.\nThis is useful when painting labels across large volumes/time series. As a\nside-benefit of this work, undo when painting labels now works across the full\nvolume rather than only in the currently-visible plane. (#2339, #2396,\npydata/sparse#435 and related PRs)</p>\n<p>We’ve also continued to make improvements to our experimental octree support,\nwhich now supports single scale tiled loading (#2372, #2391). It is still\n2D-only but continues to improve!</p>\n<p>Last but not least, this is the first release since we launched our new website\nat <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://napari.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://napari.org</a>, powered by Jupyter Book! Check it out! Huge thanks to\nKira Evans, Talley Lambert, Lia Prins, Genevieve Buckley, and others who\ncontributed (and continue to contribute) to our efforts to improve our\ndocumentation.</p>\n<p>See below for the full list of changes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"new-features\">\n<h2>New Features<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#new-features\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>Notification Manager  (#2205)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add preference dialog (#2211)</p></li>\n<li><p>Make napari strings localizable (#2429)</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"documentation\">\n<h2>Documentation<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#documentation\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>Add profiling documentation (#1998)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add release note about pydantic viewermodel (#2334)</p></li>\n<li><p>Broken link fixed for Handling Code of Conduct Reports (#2342)</p></li>\n<li><p>Update nbscreenshot docstring (#2395)</p></li>\n<li><p>Clarify benchmark docs (#2431)</p></li>\n<li><p>Make structural doc changes to better align with sitemap (#2404)</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"improvements\">\n<h2>Improvements<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#improvements\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>ColorManager take 2 (w/ pydantic) (#2204)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add basic selection model (#2293)</p></li>\n<li><p>Tooltips2 (#2310)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add a font size preview slider widget (#2318)</p></li>\n<li><p>Read multiple page from pypi (#2335)</p></li>\n<li><p>Use fancy indexing rather than full slices for label editing undo (#2339)</p></li>\n<li><p>Consolidate polygon base object (#2344)</p></li>\n<li><p>Use not mutable fields on Viewer where appropriate (#2346)</p></li>\n<li><p>Generic Button to toggle state.
