This might be our biggest\nrelease yet — see below for highlights. Note also that, following the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">NEP-29\ndeprecation policy</a>,\nwe have dropped support for Python 3.6: napari 0.4 requires Python 3.7 or\nhigher to run.</p>\n<p>napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.\nIt’s designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional\nimages. It’s built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based\nrendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy).</p>\n<p>For more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website at\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://napari.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://napari.org</a></p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"highlights\">\n<h2>Highlights<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#highlights\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>napari 0.4.0 is the culmination of months of improvements to our data models.\nIt finally brings the data from all layers into a consistent, global coordinate\nsystem. This means our display is more accurate (we aim for pixel-perfect\nprecision), and it will be easier to build applications for accurate\nmeasurement on top of napari.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the global coordinate system we are now able to display a scale bar,\naxis directions, and provide a cursor model that reports the current cursor\ncoordinates within the current world view. (Currently, physical units are not\nsupported, but they are coming soon!) We can also natively display data\ntransformed with an arbitrary affine transform, making it easy to view things\nlike light sheet data straight out of the microscope!</p>\n<p>We have also added a new layer type, our first in over a year, to display\ntracking data. Many thanks to Alan Lowe from UCL/The Turing Institute for this\ncontribution!</p>\n<p>Finally, our experimental asynchronous rendering mode continues to be improved.\nUse the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">NAPARI_ASYNC=1</span></code> environment variable to try it, and please report\nissues at <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/napari/napari/issues\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://github.com/napari/napari/issues</a>.</p>\n<p>We thank the many contributors who have made this release
