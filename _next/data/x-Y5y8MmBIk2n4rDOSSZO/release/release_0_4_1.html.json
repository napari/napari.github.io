We fixed a regression that caused the status bar to always\ndisplay information from the topmost layer, rather than the selected layer.\nWe’ve also added new minimum and average intensity projection rendering modes\nfor volumetric data. Finally, we made some useful visual improvements, such as\ndisplaying text labels identifying axes on our axes visual, and colorbars in\nour colormap selection dropdown to make colormap selection easier.</p>\n<p>A small note: we have temporarily disabled the viewer’s welcome visual while we\ninvestigate some crashes that it seemed to be contributing to. See #1905.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"new-features\">\n<h2>New Features<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#new-features\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>Live tiff loader example (#1610)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add NAPARI_EXIT_ON_ERROR (#1812)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add text labels to axes (#1860)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add minimum intensity projection shader to 3d rendering mode (#1861)</p></li>\n<li><p>Average intensity projection shader for 3d rendering (#1871)</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"improvements\">\n<h2>Improvements<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#improvements\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>Integrated plugin dialog with install/uninstall &amp; remote discovery (#1357)</p></li>\n<li><p>Use TypedEventedList and TypedList for LayerList and TransformChain (#1504)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add checkbox to labels layer controls for displaying selected color mode (#1762)</p></li>\n<li><p>Async-17: MiniMap (#1774)</p></li>\n<li><p>Async-18: Basic Quadtree Rendering (#1793)</p></li>\n<li><p>Mouse callback examples tweaks (#1796)</p></li>\n<li><p>Simplify viewer and make headless mode easier (#1808)</p></li>\n<li><p>Move viewer keybindings (#1810)</p></li>\n<li><p>Async-19: Minimap and Test Images (#1813)</p></li>\n<li><p>Pre-sort tracks data by ID and time (#1814)</p></li>\n<li><p>Enhance affine example to include scipy.ndimage (#1815)</p></li>\n<li><p>Sort tracks and track properties by ID then t (#1818)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add a simple grid object (#1821)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add example: visualize 2d+timelapse as 3D space-time images, a.k.a. “kymographs” (#1831)</p></li>\n<li><p>Async-20: Better QtTestImage (#1834)</p></li>\n<li><p>Async-21: TiledImageVisual with Texture Atlas (#1837)</p></li>\n<li><p>Return estimate for 3D texture size instead of hard-coded value (#1857)</p></li>\n<li><p>Drop old typed list (#1859)</p></li>\n<li><p>Colormap presentation in dropdown list (#1862)</p></li>\n<li><p>Async-22: Support Edge/Corner Tiles (#1867)</p></li>\n<li><p>Async-23: QtRender Fixes (#1870)</p></li>\n<li><p>Async-24: Multiscale Octree w/ Async Loading (Golden Spike) (#1876)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add reverse gray colormap (#1879)</p></li>\n<li><p>Async-25: Remove VispyCompoundImageLayer (#1890)</p></li>\n<li><p>Async-26: Artificial Delay and fixes (#1891)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add properties event (#1896)</p></li>\n<li><p>Async-27: Sparse Octree (#1892)</p></li>\n<li><p>Standardize grid events (#1926)</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"bug-fixes\">\n<h2>Bug Fixes<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#bug-fixes\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>Fix zoom of scale bar and axes visuals on launch (#1791)</p></li>\n<li><p>Fix ValueError in Layer.coordinates during layer load (#1798)</p></li>\n<li><p>Fix TransformChain.<strong>init</strong>() (#1809)</p></li>\n<li><p>Fix #1811: Move visual creation to end of <strong>init</strong> (#1835)</p></li>\n<li><p>Fix keybinding inheritance (#1838)</p></li>\n<li><p>Fix lower triangular shear values (#1839)</p></li>\n<li><p>Fix bug for painting when scale above 1  (#1840)</p></li>\n<li><p>Enhance accessibility by ensuring welcome screen contrast meets required\nstandards (#1863)</p></li>\n<li><p>Apply requested opacity in points layer (#1864)</p></li>\n<li><p>Fix active layer update (#1882)</p></li>\n<li><p>Fix affine composition order (#1884)</p></li>\n<li><p>Fix affine warning (#1886)</p></li>\n<li><p>Fix Py3.9 Big Sur bug (#1894)</p></li>\n<li><p>Make control of grouping part of public api again (#1895)</p></li>\n<li><p>Fix windows plugin dupe (#1899)</p></li>\n<li><p>Revert #1857 “Return estimate for 3D texture size instead of hard-coded value” (#1907)</p></li>\n<li><p>Hide welcome visual (#1922)</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"api-changes\">\n<h2>API Changes<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#api-changes\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p><code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Viewer.grid_view()</span></code> and <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Viewer.stack_view()</span></code> are deprecated.\nInstead, use <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">viewer.grid.enabled</span> <span class=\"pre\">=</span> <span class=\"pre\">&lt;True/False&gt;</span></code>.
