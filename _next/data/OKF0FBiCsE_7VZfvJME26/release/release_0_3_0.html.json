a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.\nIt’s designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional\nimages. It’s built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant\nGPU-based rendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy).</p>\n<p>This is the first “major” release since 0.2.0 and is the culmination of 6\nmonths of work by our developer community. We have made a small number of\nbreaking changes to the API, and added several new capabilities to napari, so\nwe encourage you to read on for more details.</p>\n<p>For more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website:\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://napari.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://napari.org</a></p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"highlights\">\n<h2>Highlights<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#highlights\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"community-and-governance\">\n<h3>Community and governance<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#community-and-governance\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h3>\n<p>After the 0.2.5 release, which was our first publicly-announced release, we\nworked to rapidly turn napari into a mature library in the scientific Python\necosystem. We added a <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://napari.org/community/code_of_conduct.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">code of\nconduct</a>, a <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://napari.org/docs/community/mission_and_values.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">mission\nand values\ndocument</a>, and\nadopted a <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://napari.org/docs/community/governance.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">community governance\nmodel</a> (based on\nscikit-image’s, and since adopted with modifications by zarr).

The same file\nformats as before are available to read (TIFF, most image file formats\nsupported by imageio, and zarr).  However, we can now <em>write</em> to all these\nformats, and read and write point and shape annotations in .csv format.\nAdditionally, we have made it possible for anyone to create packages for napari\nto read and write in any other formats through plugins.

Viewing a large dataset\nwill no longer trigger automatic — but very slow, and often unnecessary —\ngeneration of an image pyramid. Instead, we direct users to our <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/transform/plot_pyramid.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">tutorial on\nhow to generate your own\npyramid</a>\nfrom <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">scikit-image</span></code>.

To\nturn off automatic detection, you can now pass the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">multiscale=True/False</span></code>\nparameter to <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">add_image</span></code>. This replaces the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">is_pyramid</span></code> parameter which has\nnow been removed. In the future, we aim to add multiscale capabilities to all\nour layers.</p>\n<p>We have also fixed the bug where too small a tile was shown to fill the entire\ncanvas.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"points-with-properties\">\n<h3>Points with properties<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#points-with-properties\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h3>\n<p>Points are no longer generic coordinates floating in space! Each point can have\nits own personality and character :-). Specifically, each point can have an\narbitrary number of properties, and attributes such as size, face color, and\nedge color can be determined by those properties. This makes it easier to\nannotate multiple types of points in an image, such as different cell types. To\nassign properties to points you can pass a dictionary as the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">properties</span></code>\nparameter to <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">add_points</span></code>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"api-changes-and-improvements\">\n<h3>API changes and improvements<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#api-changes-and-improvements\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h3>\n<p>We are taking the opportunity of this major release to update a few APIs. We\nhope that the number of users impacted by these changes will be small.
