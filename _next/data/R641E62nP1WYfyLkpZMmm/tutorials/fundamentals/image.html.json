This enables\nnapari to seamlessly browse enormous datasets that are loaded in the right way.\nFor example, here we are browsing over 100GB of lattice lightsheet data stored\nin a zarr file:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image: lattice light sheet microscopy\" src=\"../../_images/LLSM.gif\"></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"image-pyramids\">\n<h2>image pyramids<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#image-pyramids\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>For exceptionally large datasets napari supports image pyramids. An image\npyramid is a list of arrays, where each array is downsampling of the previous\narray in the list, so that you end up with images of successively smaller and\nsmaller shapes. A standard image pyramid might have a 2x downsampling at each\nlevel, but napari can support any type of pyramid as long as the shapes are\ngetting smaller each time.</p>\n<p>Image pyramids are especially useful for incredibly large 2D images when viewed\nin 2D or incredibly large 3D images when viewed in 3D. For example this ~100k x\n200k pixel pathology image consists of 10 pyramid levels and can be easily\nbrowsed as at each moment in time we only load the level of the pyramid and the\npart of the image that needs to be displayed:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image: pathology\" src=\"../../_images/pathology.gif\"></p>\n<p>This example had precomputed image pyramids stored in a zarr file, which is best\nfor performance. If, however you don’t have a precomputed pyramid but try and\nshow a exceptionally large image napari will try and compute pyramids for you\nunless you tell it not too.</p>\n<p>You can use the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">multiscale</span></code> keyword argument to specify if your data is an\nimage pyramid or not. If you don’t provide this value, then will try and guess\nwhether your data is or needs to be an image pyramid.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"d-rendering-of-images\">\n<h2>3D rendering of images<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#d-rendering-of-images\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>All our layers can be rendered in both 2D and 3D mode, and one of our viewer\nbuttons can toggle between each mode. The number of dimensions sliders will be 2\nor 3 less than the total number of dimensions of the layer, allowing you to\nbrowse volumetric timeseries data and other high dimensional data. See for\nexample these cells undergoing mitosis in this volumetric timeseries:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image: mitorsis\" src=\"../../_images/mitosis.gif\"></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"loading-multichannel-images\">\n<h2>loading multichannel images<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#loading-multichannel-images\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>Each channel in a multichannel image can be displayed as an individual layer\nby using the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">channel_axis</span></code> argument in <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">viewer.add_image()</span></code>.

The larger contrast limit corresponds to the value of the image data that\nwill get mapped to the color defined by 1 in the colormap. All values of image\ndata larger than this value will also get mapped to this color.</p>\n<p>For example, you are looking at an image that has values between 0 and 100 with\na standard <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">gray</span></code> colormap, and you set the contrast limits to <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">(20,</span> <span class=\"pre\">75)</span></code>.

This is a reasonable default, useful for many applications.</p>\n<p>The final blending mode <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">additive</span></code> will cause the layer to blend with the layers\nbelow even when it has full opacity. This mode is especially useful for many\ncell biology applications where you have multiple different components of a cell\nlabeled in different colors.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image: blending\" src=\"../../_images/blending.png\"></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"layer-interpolation\">\n<h2>layer interpolation<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#layer-interpolation\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>We support a variety of interpolation modes when viewing 2D slices. In the\ndefault mode <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">nearest</span></code> each pixel is represented as a small square of specified\nsize. As you zoom in you will eventually see each pixel. In other modes\nneighbouring pixels are blended together according to different functions, for\nexample <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">bicubic</span></code>, which can lead to smoother looking images. For most\nscientific use-cases <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">nearest</span></code> is recommended because it does not introduce more\nartificial blurring. These modes have no effect when viewing 3D slices.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"layer-rendering\">\n<h2>layer rendering<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#layer-rendering\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>When viewing 3D slices, we support a variety of rendering modes. The default\nmode <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">mip</span></code>, or maximum intensity projection, will combine voxels at different\ndistances from the camera according to a maximum intensity projection to create\nthe 2D image that is then displayed on the screen. This mode works well for many\nbiological images such as these cells growing in culture:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image: rendering\" src=\"../../_images/rendering.png\"></p>\n<p>When viewing 2D slices the rendering mode has no effect.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"naming-layers\">\n<h2>naming layers<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#naming-layers\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>All our layers support a <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">name</span></code> property that can be set inside a text box\ninside the layer widget in the layers list. The name of each layer is forced\ninto being unique so that you can use the name to index into <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">viewer.layers</span></code> to\nretrieve the layer object.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"scaling-layers\">\n<h2>scaling layers<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#scaling-layers\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>All our layers support a <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">scale</span></code> property and keyword argument that will rescale\nthe layer multiplicatively according to the scale values (one for each\ndimension). This property can be particularly useful for viewing anisotropic\nvolumes where the size of the voxel in the z dimension might be different then\nthe size in the x and y dimensions.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"translating-layers\">\n<h2>translating layers<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#translating-layers\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>All our layers support a <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">translate</span></code> property and keyword argument that you can\nuse to offset a layer relative to the other layers, which could be useful if you\nare trying to overlay two layers for image registration purposes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"layer-metadata\">\n<h2>layer metadata<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#layer-metadata\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>All our layers also support a <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">metadata</span></code> property and keyword argument that you\ncan use to store an arbitrary metadata dictionary on the layer.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"next-steps\">\n<h2>next steps<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#next-steps\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>Hopefully, this tutorial has given you a detailed understanding of the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Image</span></code>\nlayer, including how to create one and control its properties.
