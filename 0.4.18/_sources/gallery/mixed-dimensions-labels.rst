Mixed dimensions labels
=======================

Overlay a 3D segmentation on a 4D time series.

Sometimes, our data have mixed dimensionality. napari "right-aligns" the
dimensions of your data, following NumPy broadcasting conventions [1]_. In this
example, we show how we can see a 3D segmentation overlaid on a 4D dataset. As
we slice through the dataset, the segmentation stays unchanged, but is visible
on every slice.
