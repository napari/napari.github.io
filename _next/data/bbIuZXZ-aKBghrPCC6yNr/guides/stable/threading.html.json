still-running workers when you try to quit the program.  Try the\nexample above, but quit the program <em>without</em> pressing the “STOP” button.  No\nproblem!  <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">napari</span></code> asks the thread to stop itself the next time it yields,\nand then closes without leaving any orphaned threads.</p>\n<p>Now go back to the first example with the pure (non-generator) function, and\ntry quitting before the function has returned (i.e. before the image appears).\nYou’ll notice that it takes a while to quit: it has to wait for the background\nthread to finish because there is no good way to communicate the request that\nit quit!  If you had a <em>very</em> long function, you’d be left with no choice but\nto force quit your program.</p>\n<p>So whenever possible, sprinkle your long-running functions with <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">yield</span></code>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"full-two-way-communication\">\n<h2>Full two-way communication<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#full-two-way-communication\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>So far we’ve mostly been <em>receiving</em> results from the threaded function, but we\ncan send values <em>into</em> a generator-based thread as well using\n<a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../api/stable/napari.qt.threading.GeneratorWorker.html#napari.qt.threading.GeneratorWorker.send\" title=\"napari.qt.threading.GeneratorWorker.send\"><code class=\"xref py py-meth docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">worker.send()</span></code></a> This works\nexactly like a standard python\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.send\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">generator.send</a>\npattern.

literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">@thread_worker</span></code> and instantiate\nit to create a <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">worker</span></code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>The most interesting line in this example is where we both\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">yield</span></code> the current <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">total</span></code> to the main thread (<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">yield</span> <span class=\"pre\">total</span></code>), <em>and</em>\nreceive a new value from the main thread (with <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">new</span> <span class=\"pre\">=</span> <span class=\"pre\">yield</span></code>).</p></li>\n<li><p>In the main thread, we have connected that <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">worker.yielded</span></code> event\nto a callback that pauses the worker and updates the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">result_label</span></code>\nwidget.</p></li>\n<li><p>The thread will then wait indefinitely for the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">resume()</span></code> command,\nwhich we have connected to the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">line_edit.returnPressed</span></code> signal.</p></li>\n<li><p>However, before that <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">resume()</span></code> command gets sent, we use\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">worker.send()</span></code> to send the current value of the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">line_edit</span></code> widget\ninto the thread for multiplication by the existing total.</p></li>\n<li><p>Lastly, if the thread total ever goes to “0”, we stop the thread by\nreturning the string <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">\"Game</span> <span class=\"pre\">Over\"</span></code>.  In the main thread, the\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">worker.returned</span></code> event is connected to a callback that disables the\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">line_edit</span></code> widget and shows the string returned from the thread.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This example is a bit contrived, since there’s little need to put such a basic\ncomputation in another thread.  But it demonstrates some of the power and\nfeatures provided when decorating a generator function with the\n<code class=\"xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">@thread_worker</span></code> decorator.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"syntactic-sugar\">\n<h2>Syntactic sugar<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#syntactic-sugar\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>The <code class=\"xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">@thread_worker</span></code> decorator is\njust syntactic sugar for calling <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../../api/stable/napari.qt.threading.html#napari.qt.threading.create_worker\" title=\"napari.qt.threading.create_worker\"><code class=\"xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">create_worker()</span></code></a> on\nyour function.
