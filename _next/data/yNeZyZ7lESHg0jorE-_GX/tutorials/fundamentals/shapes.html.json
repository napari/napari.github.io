For help with installation see our\n<a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"installation.html\"><span class=\"doc std std-doc\">installation</span></a> tutorial. For help getting started with the\nviewer see our <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"getting_started.html\"><span class=\"doc std std-doc\">getting started</span></a> tutorial. For help\nunderstanding the organisation of the viewer, including things like the layers\nlist, the layer properties widgets, the layer control panels, and the dimension\nsliders see our <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"viewer.html\"><span class=\"doc std std-doc\">napari viewer</span></a> tutorial.</p>\n<p>This tutorial will teach you about the <strong>napari</strong> <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Shapes</span></code> layer, including how\nto display and edit shapes like rectangle, ellipses, polygons, paths, and lines.\nAt the end of the tutorial you should understand how to add a shapes layer and\nedit it from the GUI and from the console.</p>\n<p>The points layer allows you to display a list of an NxD arrays, where each array\ncorresponds to one shape, specified by N points in D coordinates. You can adjust\nthe position, size, face color, edge color, and opacity of all the shapes\nindependently, both programmatically and from the GUI.</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"a-simple-example\">\n<h2>a simple example<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#a-simple-example\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>You can create a new viewer and add a list of shapes in one go using the\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">napari.view_shapes</span></code> method, or if you already have an existing viewer, you can\nadd shapes to it using <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">viewer.add_shapes</span></code>. The api of both methods is the same.\nIn these examples we’ll mainly use <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">add_shapes</span></code> to overlay shapes onto on

list of NxD numpy array, with each\narray containing the coordinates of the N vertices in D dimensions that make up\nthe shape. The ordering of these dimensions is the same as the ordering of the\ndimensions for image layers. This list of arrays is always accessible through\nthe <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">layer.data</span></code> property and will grow or shrink as new shapes are either added\nor deleted. By storing data as a list of arrays it is possible for each shape to\nhave a different number of vertices in it. This is especially useful when\ndrawing polygons or paths.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"adding-different-shape-types\">\n<h2>adding different shape types<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#adding-different-shape-types\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>Right now the shapes layer supports 5 types of shapes, <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Lines</span></code>, <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Rectangles</span></code>,\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Ellipses</span></code>, <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Polygons</span></code>, and <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Paths</span></code>. When adding new data can set the shape type\nthrough the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">shape_type</span></code> keyword argument, as either a single shape type if all\nthe shapes to be added have the same type or as a list of shape types if some of\nthe shapes have different types. The actual shape types of all the shapes is\naccessible through the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">layer.shape_types</span></code> property. Selecting different shape\ncreation tools will cause shapes of the different types to be added.</p>\n<p><code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Lines</span></code> consist of two vertices representing the end points of the line. The\nline creation tool can be selected from the layer control panel or by pressing\nthe <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">L</span></code> key when the shapes layer is selected. When adding a new line the first\nclick will coordinates of the first endpoint and the second click will mark the\ncoordinates of the second endpoint. You’ll then be able to add another line.</p>\n<p><code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Rectangles</span></code> can be added using two vertices representing the corners of the\nrectangle for axis aligned rectangle, or using four corners so that non-axis\naligned rectangle can be represented too. Internally we use the four vertex\nrepresentation so we can always support rotated rectangles. The rectangle\ncreation tool can be selected from the layer control panel or by pressing the\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">R</span></code> key when the shapes layer is selected. When adding a rectangle you must\nclick and drag the rectangle to have the desired shape. When you release the\nmouse the rectangle will be completed and you’ll then be able to add another\none. If you just make a single click then a rectangle of default size will be\ncreated centered on that click.</p>\n<p><code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Ellipses</span></code> can be added using either two vectors, one representing the center\nposition of the ellipse and the other representing the radii of the ellipse in\nall dimensions for an axis aligned ellipse, or by using the four corners of the\nellipse bounding box for a non-axis aligned ellipse. Internally we use the four\nvertex representation so we can always support rotated ellipses. The ellipse\ncreation tool can be selected from the layer control panel or by pressing the\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">E</span></code> key when the shapes layer is selected. When adding an ellipse you must click\nand drag the ellipse to have the desired shape. When you release the mouse the\nellipse will be completed and you’ll then be able to add another one. If you\njust make a single click then an ellipse of default size will be created\ncentered on that click.</p>\n<p><code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Polygons</span></code> can be added using an array of N vertices. Polygons are closed by\ndefault, and so you don’t also need to include the first point at the end of the\narray. The order of the vertices will determine the triangulation of the\npolygon, which can be non-convex, but cannot have holes. The polygon creation\ntool can be selected from the layer control panel or by pressing the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">P</span></code> key\nwhen the shapes layer is selected. When adding a polygon each click will add a\nvertex at the clicked location. To finish drawing a polygon you must click the\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">escape</span></code> key, which will add a final vertex at the current mouse position and\ncomplete the polygon. You’ll then be able to start adding another one.</p>\n<p><code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Paths</span></code> are like polygons but are not closed or filled in. They can also be\nadded using an array of N vertices. The path creation tool can be selected from\nthe layer control panel or by pressing the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">T</span></code> key when the shapes layer is\nselected. When adding a path each click will add a vertex at the clicked\nlocation. To finish drawing a path you must click the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">escape</span></code> key, which will\nadd a final vertex at the current mouse position and complete the path. You’ll\nthen be able to start adding another one.</p>\n<p>When using the shapes addition or editing tools the pan and zoom functionality\nof the viewer canvas is disabled and you can edit the layer.
