It’s designed for\nbrowsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional images. It’s built\non top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based rendering), and the\nscientific Python stack (numpy, scipy).</p>\n<p>This is our first minor release, timed for the 2019 SciPy Conference in Austin.\nIt marks our transition from pre-alpha to alpha, and establishes a reasonable\nAPI for adding images, shapes, and other basic layer types to an interactive\nviewer. It supports launching a viewer with python scripting or from Jupyter\nnotebooks.</p>\n<p>For more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website:\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/napari/napari\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://github.com/napari/napari</a></p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"pull-requests\">\n<h2>Pull Requests<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#pull-requests\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>Add shapes (#100)</p></li>\n<li><p>Vectors Layer (#129)</p></li>\n<li><p>setup css basics (#167)</p></li>\n<li><p>Update shields on README (#169)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add dimension sliders (#171)</p></li>\n<li><p>New more convenient ViewerApp API (#172)</p></li>\n<li><p>WIP: Labels layer (#175)</p></li>\n<li><p>automate running/testing of examples (#176)</p></li>\n<li><p>fix error with nD markers (#183)</p></li>\n<li><p>fix sphinx-apidoc command on <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://CONTRIBUTING.MD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">CONTRIBUTING.MD</a> (#187)</p></li>\n<li><p>Allow other array-like data (#188)</p></li>\n<li><p>Add example using a Zarr array (#191)</p></li>\n<li><p>readme updates (#192)</p></li>\n<li><p>fix empty markers (#194)</p></li>\n<li><p>Interactive labels (#195)</p></li>\n<li><p>improve layer selection / name editing (#196)</p></li>\n<li><p>Rasterize shapes (#197)</p></li>\n<li><p>Fix color map to work with unlimited labels.
