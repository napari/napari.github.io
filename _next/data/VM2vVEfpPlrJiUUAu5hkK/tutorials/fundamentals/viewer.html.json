For help getting started with the\nviewer see our <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"getting_started.html\"><span class=\"doc std std-doc\">getting started</span></a> tutorial.</p>\n<p>This tutorial will teach you about the <strong>napari</strong> viewer, including how to use\nits graphical user interface (GUI) and how the data within it is organized. At\nthe end of the tutorial you should understand the both the layout of the viewer\non the screen and the data inside of it.</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"launching-the-viewer\">\n<h2>launching the viewer<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#launching-the-viewer\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>As discussed in <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"getting_started.html\"><span class=\"doc std std-doc\">getting started</span></a> tutorial the napari viewer\ncan be launched from the command-line, a python script, an IPython console, or a\njupyter notebook. All four methods launch the same viewer, and anything related\nto the interacting with the viewer on the screen applies equally to all of them.\nWe will use the syntax inside python scripts so you can copy and paste these\nexamples into scripts and run them.</p>\n<p>Let’s get stated by launching a viewer with a simple 2D image.</p>\n<p>The fastest way to get the viewer open and throw an image up on the screen is\nusing the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">napari.view_image</span></code> method:</p>\n<div class=\"cell docutils container\">\n<div class=\"cell_input docutils container\">\n<div class=\"highlight-default notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">napari</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">skimage</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">data</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">viewer</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">napari</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">view_image</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">data</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">astronaut</span><span class=\"p\">(),</span> <span class=\"n\">rgb</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"kc\">True</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Calling <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">napari.view_image</span></code> will return a <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Viewer</span></code> object that is the main\nobject inside <strong>napari</strong>. All the data you add to <strong>napari</strong> will be stored\ninside the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Viewer</span></code> object and will be accessible from it. This command will\nalso open the viewer to create a GUI that you can interact with.</p>\n<p>You can also create an empty <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Viewer</span></code> directly and then start adding images to\nit.

While much consumer photography is 2D\nand <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">RGB</span></code>, scientific image data can often be volumetric (i.e. 3D), volumetric\ntimeseries (i.e. 4D), or even higher dimensional. <strong>napari</strong> places no limits on\nthe dimensionality of its input data for all its layer types.</p>\n<p>Adding data with a dimensionality greater than 2D will cause dimension sliders\nto appear directly underneath the main canvas and above the status bar. As many\nsliders as needed will appear to ensure the data can be fully browsed. For\nexample, a 3D dataset needs one slider, a 4D dataset needs two sliders, and so\non. The widths of the scroll bars of the dimension sliders are directly related\nto how many slices are in each dimension.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to mix data of different shapes and dimensionality in\ndifferent layers. If a 2D and 4D dataset are both added to the viewer then the\nsliders will only affect the 4D dataset and the 2D dataset will be remain the\nsame.

For example, we want to enable workflows where people\ncan interact with the GUI, say click on the centers of some objects, or paint\nover some regions and then perform custom analysis. As a first step towards\nenabling custom interactivity we’ve provided support to add your own custom\nkeybindings to the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Viewer</span></code> or individual <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Layer</span></code> objects such that when the\ncorresponding key gets clicked your custom function gets executed. Depending on\nwhich object you bind your key to, your function will either get access to the\nstate of the entire <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">viewer</span></code> or <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">layer</span></code> object.</p>\n<p>For example, to bind function that loops through all layers in the viewer and\nprints their names to your console when you press the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">p</span></code> key you can do the\nfollowing:</p>\n<div class=\"cell docutils container\">\n<div class=\"cell_input docutils container\">\n<div class=\"highlight-default notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"n\">viewer</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">napari</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Viewer</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"n\">viewer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">add_image</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">data</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">astronaut</span><span class=\"p\">(),</span> <span class=\"n\">name</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s1\">'astronaut'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"nd\">@viewer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">bind_key</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'p'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">print_names</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">viewer</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"nb\">print</span><span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"n\">layer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">name</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">layer</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">viewer</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">layers</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n</pre></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>By default, your key will bind to the key press event, but it is also possible\nto bind to the key release event by including a <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">yield</span></code> inside your function.\nAll code before the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">yield</span></code> will get executed on key press and all code after\nthe <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">yield</span></code> will get executed on key release.
