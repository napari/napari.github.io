This can <em>greatly</em> improve performance, but it means that the\npackage must be compiled for <em>each</em> platform (i.e. Windows, Mac, Linux) that the\npackage wants to support.  Some packages do this compilation step ahead of time,\nby distributing “<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://realpython.com/python-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">wheels</a>” on\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://pypi.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">PyPI</a>… or by providing pre-compiled packages via <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">conda</span></code>.\nOther packages simply distribute the source code (as an “sdist”) and expect the\nend-user to compile it on their own computer.  Compiling C code requires\nsoftware that is not always installed on every computer. (If you’ve ever tried\nto <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">pip</span> <span class=\"pre\">install</span></code> a package and had it fail with a big wall of red text saying\nsomething about <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">gcc</span></code>, then you’ve run into a package that doesn’t distribute\nwheels, and you didn’t have the software required to compile it).</p>\n</div>\n<p>As a plugin developer, if you depend on a package that uses C extensions but\ndoesn’t distribute a pre-compiled wheel, then it’s very likely that your users\nwill run into difficulties installing your plugin:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>What is a “wheel”?</em></p>\n<p>Briefly, a wheel is a <em>built distribution</em>, containing code that is\npre-compiled for a specific operating system.</p>\n<p>For more detail, see <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://realpython.com/python-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">What Are Python Wheels and Why Should You\nCare?</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>How do I know if my dependency offers a wheel</em></p>\n<p>There are many ways, but a sure-fire way to know is to go to the respective\npackage on PyPI, and click on the “Download Files” link.  If the package\noffers wheels, you’ll see one or more files ending in <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">.whl</span></code>.  For example,\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://pypi.org/project/napari/#files\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">napari offers a wheel</a>.  If a package\n<em>doesn’t</em> offer a wheel, it may still be ok if it’s just a pure python package\nthat doesn’t have any C extensions…</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>How do I know if one of my dependencies uses C Extensions?</em></p>\n<p>There’s no one right way, but more often than not, if a package uses C\nextensions, the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">setup()</span></code> function in their <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">setup.py</span></code> file will use the\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html#describing-extension-modules\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">ext_modules</span></code>\nargument</a>.\n(for example, <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/setup.py#L914\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">see here in\npytorch</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"admonition-what-about-conda admonition\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">What about conda?</p>\n<p><strong>conda</strong> also distributes &amp; installs pre-compiled packages, though they aren’t\nwheels.  While this is definitely a fine way to install binary dependencies in a\nreliable way, the built-in napari plugin installer doesn’t currently work with\nconda.  If your dependency is only available on conda, but does not offer\nwheels,you <em>may</em> guide your users in using conda to install your package or one\nof your dependencies.  Just know that it may not work with the built-in plugin\ninstaller.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"don-t-import-heavy-dependencies-at-the-top-of-your-module\">\n<h2>Don’t import heavy dependencies at the top of your module<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#don-t-import-heavy-dependencies-at-the-top-of-your-module\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Note</p>\n<p>This point will be less relevant when we move to the second generation\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/3115\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">manifest-based plugin\ndeclaration</a>, but it’s still a\ngood idea to delay importing your plugin-specific dependencies and modules until\n<em>after</em> your hookspec has been called.
