specifications for pluggable functionality are defined here.</span>\n\n<span class=\"sd\">A *hook specification* is a function signature (with documentation) that</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">declares an API that plugin developers must adhere to when providing hook</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">implementations.  *Hook implementations* provided by plugins (and internally by</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">napari) will then be invoked in various places throughout the code base.</span>\n\n<span class=\"sd\">When implementing a hook specification, pay particular attention to the number</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">and types of the arguments in the specification signature, as well as the</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">expected return type.</span>\n\n<span class=\"sd\">To allow for hook specifications to evolve over the lifetime of napari,</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">hook implementations may accept *fewer* arguments than defined in the</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">specification. (This allows for extending existing hook arguments without</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">breaking existing implementations). However, implementations must not require</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">*more* arguments than defined in the spec.</span>\n\n<span class=\"sd\">For more general background on the plugin hook calling mechanism, see the</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">`napari-plugin-manager documentation</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">&lt;https://napari-plugin-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_.</span>\n\n<span class=\"sd\">.. NOTE::</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">    Hook specifications are a feature borrowed from `pluggy</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">    &lt;https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#specs&gt;`_. In the `pluggy</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">    documentation &lt;https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_, hook</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">    specification marker instances are named ``hookspec`` by convention, and</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">    hook implementation marker instances are named ``hookimpl``.  The</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">    convention in napari is to name them more explicitly:</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">    ``napari_hook_specification`` and ``napari_hook_implementation``,</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">    respectively.</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">\"\"\"</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># These hook specifications also serve as the API reference for plugin</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># developers, so comprehensive documentation with complete type annotations is</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># imperative!</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">__future__</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">annotations</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">types</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">FunctionType</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">typing</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Any</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">Dict</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">List</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">Optional</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">Tuple</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">Union</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">napari_plugin_engine</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">napari_hook_specification</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">..types</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">AugmentedWidget</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">ReaderFunction</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">SampleData</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">SampleDict</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">WriterFunction</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\"># -------------------------------------------------------------------------- #</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">#                                 IO Hooks                                   #</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># -------------------------------------------------------------------------- #</span>\n\n\n<div class=\"viewcode-block\" id=\"napari_provide_sample_data\"><a class=\"viewcode-back\" href=\"../../../plugins/stable/hook_specifications.html#napari.plugins.hook_specifications.napari_provide_sample_data\">[docs]</a><span class=\"nd\">@napari_hook_specification</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">historic</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"kc\">True</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">napari_provide_sample_data</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"o\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">Dict</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nb\">str</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">Union</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">SampleData</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">SampleDict</span><span class=\"p\">]]:</span>\n    <span class=\"sd\">\"\"\"Provide sample data.</span>\n\n<span class=\"sd\">    Plugins may implement this hook to provide sample data for use in napari.</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">    Sample data is accessible in the `File &gt; Open Sample` menu, or</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">    programmatically, with :meth:`napari.Viewer.open_sample`.</span>\n\n<span class=\"sd\">    Plugins implementing this hook specification must return a ``dict``, where</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">    each key is a `sample_key` (the string that will appear in the</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">    `Open Sample` menu), and the value is either a string, or</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">    a callable that returns an iterable of ``LayerData`` tuples, where each</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">    tuple is a 1-, 2-, or 3-tuple of ``(data,)``, ``(data, meta)``, or ``(data,</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">    meta, layer_type)`` (thus, an individual sample-loader may provide multiple</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">    layers).
